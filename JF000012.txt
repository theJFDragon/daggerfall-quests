<ce>             You, %ra, you look like the type who doesn't
<ce>             mind getting their hands dirty. And I mean really dirty.
<ce>             
<ce>             I will elucidate. I own countless properties, estates
<ce>             and businesses across the province. It is a heavy burden
<ce>             but I shoulder it with the dignity and humility appropriate
<ce>             to my station.
<ce>             
<ce>             Some of these enterprises are not as profitable as they
<ce>             once were. Doubtless the cause is the inherent idleness
<ce>             and criminality of the peasantry I am forced to employ.
<ce>             
<ce>             I need somebody to visit these places, inspect them
<ce>             and resolve their inadequacies. I don't care what steps
<ce>             are taken as long as it is quick, cheap and effective.
<ce>             I usually find that threats of violence, combined with
<ce>             actual violence, usually do the trick.
<ce>             
<ce>             Do you accept this great and necessary undertaking?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             I recall with great fondness a time when people like
<ce>             you knew their place and followed orders. We didn't
<ce>             even have to pay. If you refused we just arrested
<ce>             your families.
<ce>             
<ce>             Oh, happy days...

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Good. I've had this report prepared. It contains
<ce>             everything you need to know.
<ce>             
<ce>             You do know how to read, %ra?
<ce>             
<ce>             Never mind, I'll have one of my adjutants go with
<ce>             you to make sure you don't get lost.
<ce>             
<ce>             Oh, and by the way, I need this resolved in 60 days.
<ce>             That should be ample time. On your way, then.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Neolithic incompetence is such an unattractive trait.
<ce>             Depart. And do not return.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Well done %ra, you have proven significantly more
<ce>             competent than I expected.

If you find anyone who knows how to mine ebony send them my way, eh?

We have no further business. Leave. Now.

_daughter_? Oh yeah, you can find her at __daughter_.


Message:  1040
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 wants me to find out why his various
 businesses are losing money. To keep
 an eye on me I am accompanied by an
 assistant, _assistant_.
 They'd better not cause any problems.
 Also _questgiver_ gave
 me a document. I should probably read
 the document.

 The problems in the tavern have been
 resolved satisfactorily.

Message:  1045
%qdt:
 I failed to complete all of
 _questgiver_'s tasks within the
 alloted time.

Message:  1046
%qdt:
 Somebody wouldn't do exactly what we wanted
 so it looks like we're going to abduct their
 daughter. Name of _daughter_,
 apparently lives in ___daughter_.

Message:  1047
%qdt:
 _assistant_ wants us to speak with
 _warlock_, who can be found in the
 Mages Guild in _magesGuild_.

Message:  1048
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ has an alchemist
 processing illegal narcotics, but
 without a sample from their stash
 they're in no fit state for anything.
 
 Unfortunately that means I have to
 scour every corner of some place called
 ___dungeon_.

Message:  1050
<ce>             The report lists four businesses that _questgiver_
<ce>             wants you to investigate and sort out.
<ce>             
<ce>             First, a tavern called _tavern_,
<ce>             located in __tavern_.
<ce>             The manager's name is _manager_.
<ce>             
<ce>             Second, an agricultural concern called
<ce>             __farm_.
<ce>             
<ce>             Next is a shop in __shop_,
<ce>             called _shop_.
<ce>             
<ce>             And finally an alchemists named
<ce>             _chemist_,
<ce>             registered in __chemist_.

Message:  1051
<ce>             "I don't know who you are and I don't care. I'm the boss of this
<ce>             establishment and our absent landlord had better get used to it.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Now, I think it's time for you to leave. To make sure that you
<ce>             don't find your way back inside our security will take care of you."

Message:  1052
<ce>             The manager denies, most unconvincingly, ever skimming profits
<ce>             from the tavern's coffers. Without a word you pick up the iron
<ce>             poker from the fireplace and carefully bend it around their neck.
<ce>             It's a tight fit but not too tight.
<ce>             
<ce>             When you ask if the tavern's profits will be sent to the correct
<ce>             destination the manager nods eagerly.
<ce>             
<ce>             Your work here is done.

Message:  1053
<ce>             The manager tries, badly, to deny ever stealing from the tavern
<ce>             coffers.
<ce>             
<ce>             Thanks to a combination of your winning personality and 
<ce>             superlative street-smarts you persuade the errant manager
<ce>             that their physical and mental health will be best
<ce>             ensured by their not skimming profits from the tavern.
<ce>             
<ce>             You are confident that everything will be run correctly
<ce>             from now on.

Message:  1054
<ce>             _manager_ drops to their knees and pleads.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Okay, okay! Stop! Look, we'll go back to running this place
<ce>             like we did before, okay?! Just stop killing people!
<ce>             Tell _questgiver_ there'll be no problems, alright?!"
<ce>             
<ce>             _assistant_ emerges from your shadow and
<ce>             berates the manager some more. It is made clear exactly
<ce>             how the tavern will operate from now on.

Message:  1055
<ce>             As you enter the tavern _assistant_ 
<ce>             pipes up.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Don't worry about the barkeep. We should talk with
<ce>             the manager, _manager_."

Message:  1056
<ce>             _assistant_ immediately cowers behind you
<ce>             and squeals, "This is mutiny! Kill them all!"
<ce>             
<ce>             From a nearby room you hear the clang of
<ce>             swords being readied...

Message:  1057
<ce>             _assistant_ stops day-dreaming and looks around.
<ce>             
<ce>             "__farm_ produces the usual products.
<ce>             Some wheat, a little fruit and an assortment of
<ce>             regional vegetables.
<ce>             
<ce>             "But their main crop is _drug_. Not entirely
<ce>             legal but very profitable. Far too profitable
<ce>             for the meagre returns they've been sending in
<ce>             for the past few months.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Wait here, I'll go and see what's what."
<ce>             
<ce>             With that _assistant_ wanders off, which
<ce>             strikes you as uncharacteristically brave.

Message:  1058
<ce>             After a few minutes you hear raised voices.
<ce>             _assistant_ emerges and they
<ce>             do not look happy.

Message:  1059
<ce>             "Sadly, I wasn't able to persuade them that
<ce>             they are not an independent operation."
<ce>             
<ce>             _assistant_ steps behind you as a gang of
<ce>             armed thugs emerges from the farmhouse.
<ce>             They start moving in your direction.
<ce>             
<ce>             "You can handle things from here, right?"

Message:  1060
<ce>             "They were not amnable to my reasonable
<ce>             suggestions. Give me a moment."
<ce>             
<ce>             _assistant_ thinks for a while...
<ce>             
<ce>             "Aha! Their ringleader is a very superstitious
<ce>             type. They have a particular fear to all things
<ce>             undead and supernatural.
<ce>             
<ce>             "I know a warlock at the Mages Guild in 
<ce>             __magesGuild_. Let's pay
<ce>             them a visit."

Message:  1061
<ce>             Once the last of the thugs is dead _assistant_
<ce>             starts checking the bodies. He gives out a cry
<ce>             of triumph.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Yes! This is the ringleader. With him out of the
<ce>             way the rest of the workers will fall back in line.
<ce>             I think our work here is done."

Message:  1062
<ce>             The warlock recognises _assistant_ immediately. 
<ce>             Fortunately everyone seems on good terms.
<ce>             
<ce>             "_assistant_, it's been a long time," the
<ce>             warlock begins. "Doubtless you have need of my
<ce>             assistance in some nefarious, under-handed
<ce>             scheme. How can I help?"
<ce>             
<ce>             _assistant_ explains his desire to purchase
<ce>             an enchanted gem which can summon placid zombies.
<ce>             
<ce>             "I have the very thing. One moment." The warlock
<ce>             rumages around and then presents you with a
<ce>             sparkling gemstone. _assistant_ slips it
<ce>             into his pocket and hands over a curse of coins.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Now let's get back to __farm_ and
<ce>             have some fun."

Message:  1063
<ce>             The enchanted gem glows brightly and then rapidly
<ce>             fades until it resembles a dull stone. You hear
<ce>             the familiar murmur that is the signature of the
<ce>             animated dead. 
<ce>             
<ce>             And as promised the newly-summoned zombies are
<ce>             thankfully docile. _assistant_ looks
<ce>             even smugger than usual and trots off to find
<ce>             the ringleader.

Message:  1064
<ce>             After a few minutes _assistant_ re-appears.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Everything is arranged. I persuaded them that
<ce>             the zombies will be as harmless as statues, as
<ce>             long as this operation runs the way we want it
<ce>             to run. Our work here is done."
<ce>             
<ce>             Time to move on...

Message:  1065
<ce>             "Well done %ra, I am actually impressed.
<ce>             Of course _assistant_'s report
<ce>             tried to steal most of the credit, but naturally,
<ce>             I don't believe everything that snivelling
<ce>             lickspittle says.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Here's your payment. I hope we can do equally
<ce>             profitable business again soon."

Message:  1066
<ce>             As you enter the shop _assistant_
<ce>             pulls on your arm and whispers, "this store is
<ce>             used for, how shall I put it, turning money from
<ce>             our not-entirely legal activities, into perfectly
<ce>             ordinary money.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Ignore the shopkeeper, they're just a puppet.
<ce>             This operation is run by the accountant,
<ce>             _accountant_. They'll be around here
<ce>             somewhere. Maybe we can find something
<ce>             in the secret ledger?"

Message:  1067
<ce>             The accountant recognises _assistant_
<ce>             and reluctantly produces a small, leather-bound
<ce>             notebook. _assistant_ snatches it,
<ce>             flicks through it, clearly not understanding
<ce>             the contents and then hands it to you.
<ce>             
<ce>             After studying the ledger for some time your
<ce>             mastery of the administration of business
<ce>             finally pays off. Despite the accountant's
<ce>             attempts to conceal the truth you pinpoint
<ce>             several transactions that do not add up.
<ce>             
<ce>             Faced with evidence of his embezzeling the
<ce>             accountant's nerve cracks and he begs for
<ce>             mercy, even forcing a large sack of coins
<ce>             into _assistant_'s hands.
<ce>             
<ce>             "I think this problem is resolved."
<ce>             _assistant_ beams an insufferable smile.
<ce>             It's time to move on.

Message:  1068
<ce>             The accountant recognises _assistant_

<ce>             the contents and then hands it to you.
<ce>             
<ce>             The ledger contains a massive list of numbers
<ce>             that means absolutely nothing to you. With
<ce>             a smug grin the accountant takes back the
<ce>             ledger and puts it back in his pocket.
<ce>             
<ce>             _assistant_ steers you aside and
<ce>             whispers, "I seem to recall that _accountant_
<ce>             has a charming daughter called _daughter_
<ce>             who lives somewhere in ___daughter_.
<ce>             Let's pay her a visit..."

Message:  1069
<ce>             Before you can do anything _assistant_
<ce>             clamps a cloth over _daughter_'s face.
<ce>             She immediately slumps into unconsciousness.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Don't worry, she'll be fine. As long as
<ce>             that crooked accountant co-operates."

Message:  1070
<ce>             The blood drains from _accountant_'s
<ce>             face as %g1 sees %g3 daughter slumped
<ce>             over your shoulder.
<ce>             
<ce>             _assistant_ starts to toy with a very
<ce>             small, but very sharp, dagger.
<ce>             
<ce>             The point is made. The accountant
<ce>             reluctantly admits their embezzlement
<ce>             and hands over several bags of coins
<ce>             to _assistant_, who produces
<ce>             the potion required to revive the
<ce>             unconscious girl.

<ce>             "This place is a front for other work our
<ce>             businesses require", _assistant_
<ce>             explains. "The raw materials from our

<ce>             few other similiar establishments.

Message:  1072
<ce>             The tame alchemist has clearly been sampling
<ce>             the merchandise. Despite their condition you
<ce>             are able to cajole, persuade, inveigle, blandish
<ce>             coax and induce them to get back to work.
<ce>             
<ce>             For good measure _assistant_ then makes
<ce>             it clear that if productivity drops again then
<ce>             a serious and debilitating addiction will be the
<ce>             least of their problems.
<ce>             
<ce>             You have no further business here.

Message:  1073
<ce>             The alchemist half-listens to _assistant_'s
<ce>             accusations and doesn't seem particularly 
<ce>             fazed by threats. The nervous twitching and
<ce>             constantly darting, glazed-over eyes are
<ce>             symptoms of some sort of addiction.
<ce>             
<ce>             When _assistant_'s invective finally
<ce>             runs out of steam the alchemist mumbles
<ce>             that they need an antidote to cure their
<ce>             withdrawal symptoms.
<ce>             
<ce>             The 'antidote' is a large piece of _drug2_
<ce>             which the alchmemist has inexplicably
<ce>             hidden away in ___dungeon_ for
<ce>             safe-keeping.
<ce>             
<ce>             Looks like you have another detour!

Message:  1074
<ce>             The alchemist grabs hungrily at the sample
<ce>             of _drug2_ and devours it. With their
<ce>             addition sated, at least for the moment,
<ce>             you are able to communicate clearly.
<ce>             
<ce>             _assistant_ makes it clear that next
<ce>             time production grinds to a halt the
<ce>             alchmemist will be taken to the farmstead
<ce>             and used as fertiliser.
<ce>             
<ce>             From the look on their face you think the
<ce>             lesson has been learnt. Time to move on.

<ce>             "I can't imagine why you have returned with your
<ce>             duties unfinished. The clock is ticking, %ra.
<ce>             Get moving, and remember, I don't pay for a job
<ce>             half done. Or even ninety-nine percent done."

<ce>             This is the secret stash. We can leave now.
