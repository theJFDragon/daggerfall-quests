QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             Looking for work, but not a Guild member? Hmmm.
<ce>             Well, we do have a contract with the Imperial
<ce>             Express courier service. It's simple work, just
<ce>             delivering and collecting packages, but it's
<ce>             steady pay. Are you interested?
<--->
<ce>             You want some work, eh? But you're not a Guild
<ce>             member? How about some simple courier jobs?
<ce>             We have a deal with the Imperial Express service.
<ce>             Not very exciting but honest pay for honest work.
<ce>             You up for it?
<--->
<ce>             We have a big pile of packages that the Imperial
<ce>             Express courier service paid us to deliver. Most
<ce>             Guild members aren't interested in this work, but
<ce>             it's simple, easy and honest pay.
<ce>             
<ce>             It's also the only work I can offer you right now.
<ce>             What do you say?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Suit yourself.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Great. I don't know the details and I don't want
<ce>             to know. I just have this big list of deliveries
<ce>             to tick off. Let's start at the top. Take this
<ce>             work order, it has all the details.
<ce>             
<ce>             Try to complete the delivery in the next thirty
<ce>             days. Most of this stuff has already been here
<ce>             for ages but we should probably not make them
<ce>             wait forever.
<ce>             
<ce>             Good luck. Don't get lost and don't be late.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             I don't rate your future if you can't even deliver
<ce>             a simple package in time. This is as easy as it gets.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             All done? Great, another one off the list. Come back
<ce>             if you want more of the same. There's still a lot of
<ce>             packages in the back waiting to be delivered.

The Cartographers are excited. I wonder why? Probably something to do with maps, I guess.

 I've been given a job to deliver
 a large sack. The details are in
 the delivery note I was given.
 
 Once I'm done I should head back to
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 to get paid.

%qdt:
 I've been given a delivery job.
 First I have to visit the Fighters
 Guild in ___fightersGuild_
 to collect the package, then take
 it to the address in the delivery note.

 Once I'm done I should head back to
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 to get paid.

Message:  1042
%qdt:
 Some goon tried to kill me. There
 was no sign of the receipient of
 the package. I guess this job is
 a bust?

Message:  1043
%qdt:
 The delivery for the Mages Guild
 did not go entirely smoothly.
 Whatever was in the bag I delivered
 managed to summon a daedra!

 Fortunately I am not contractually
 required to resolve such problems.

Message:  1044
%qdt:
 Although the delivery was for a
 criminal smuggler who was using a
 fake name and who had since been
 abducted by a rival gang I was
 able to successfully find them
 and make the delivery.
 
 I doubt anyone will appreciate this
 dedication to duty.

<ce>             Alright, then. Thanks, I guess."

<ce>             Come back when you're done with that.
<ce>             I can't keep my quest register updated
<ce>             correctly if people don't finish what
<ce>             they start."

Message:  1062
<ce>             This is the place. One of the Guild workers
<ce>             examines your delivery note, heads off and
<ce>             comes back with a large sack.
<ce>             
<ce>             You can now finish this delivery.

<ce>             I discovered that idiot _otherPerson_
<ce>             is sending their stuff through the Imperial
<ce>             Express courier service. We need to intercept
<ce>             the next package before they find out what's
<ce>             going on. At least %g1 had the brains to use a
<ce>             false name.
<ce>             
<ce>             Don't worry about %g2, I've arranged for %g2
<ce>             to be in __house3_ for a few days.
<ce>             
<ce>             Take care of things and I'll cut you in for a
<ce>             bigger slice on the next job.
