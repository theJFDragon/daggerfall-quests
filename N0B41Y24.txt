<ce>                 If you have some time on your hands,
<ce>                I have a very important mission for you.
<ce>                The risks are high, but I will pay well.
<ce>                              Interested?
                                     <--->
<ce>                It seems that I must ask for your help
<ce>                 in a very dangerous matter.  The Mages
<ce>                 Guild has found the location of a very
<ce>                dangerous, magical scroll.  We fear that
<ce>                 someone may use it unknowingly, and so
<ce>               we must find it ourselves.  I will pay you
<ce>             well if you are the one that brings it to me.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      I see that your loyalty to
<ce>                        the guild, and that your
<ce>                        care for your safety is
<ce>                                limited.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Good.  Now, the scroll I seek is hidden away
<ce>             in ___mondung_.  It has been here for hundreds
<ce>             of years, but the guild never knew of it until
<ce>           just recently.  The powers within it could destroy
<ce>               an entire city, if used improperly.  Go to
<ce>                 ___mondung_, and find it.  Do not read
<ce>            it, for that will unleash the powers within it.
<ce>              Bring it back to me, and I will give you an
<ce>              enchanted _mitem_.  You have =queston_ days.
<ce>                         Please do not fail me.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 You have done well.  I hope that you
<ce>               did not read the scroll.  Now, I promised
<ce>                      you a _mitem_.  Here you go.

I got a boil the other day ... but it healed.
<--->
I just had a three hour conversation about the weather.
<--->
The weather is pretty usual for this time of year.
<--->
It seems a trifle coolish in %cn for this time of year.
<--->
It sure is a lot warmer today than this time last year.
<--->
My great aunt is going to a specialist across the Bay.
<--->
It's always funny what time it gets dark around here.
<--->
We should erect a war statue around here.
<--->
The kids these days with their magic. %oth, I don't know.
<--->
I had the weirdest dream last night.
<--->
I heard a great joke. %jok
<--->
%jok Actually, that's a joke.
<--->
%jok Can you explain that to me?
<--->
The legal system in %reg has it good points and bad ones.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The Mages Guild is conducting some wierd research.
<--->
I wonder what goes on behind the closed doors of the Mages Guild?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Welcome, my friend!  I trust you are feeling well?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You are the one that could not get me that scroll!  Begone!

%qdt:
 The Mages guild of ___qgiver_
 has asked me to find a magical scroll
 in ___mondung_.  It is
 considered very dangerous, and I should
 not read it.  I have =queston_ days.

<ce>                   You pick up the scroll, and feel
<ce>                   it burning your hand.  You quickly
<ce>                   put it into your backpack, and you
<ce>                     hear a strange moaning sound.

Message:  1013
<ce>                     A large ball of fire explodes
<ce>                    from the scroll.  You jump away
<ce>                   from it, and watch as the strange
<ce>                   scroll burns to nothing.  Horrible
<ce>                    moans and screams fill the air,
<ce>                    and it seems as if the scroll is
<ce>                  letting something out of it.  Then,
<ce>                    as quick as it started, the fire
<ce>                    disappears.  The scroll is gone.

Message:  1014
<ce>                       You have meddled with the
<ce>                       powers of a Death Scroll.
<ce>                        Now I must destroy you.

Message:  1015
<ce>                   As you finish reading the scroll,
<ce>                     a pain begins to grow in your
<ce>                   chest.   You scream, and it feels
<ce>                   as though something is inside you,
<ce>                trying to get out.  Suddenly, the scroll
<ce>                    you hold begins to glow, and the
<ce>                    pain goes away.  The energy from
<ce>                  the scroll leaves it, and creates a
<ce>                        vampire in front of you!
