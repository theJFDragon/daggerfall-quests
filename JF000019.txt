QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             Excuse me, %ra? Can you spare a moment?
<ce>             Perhaps you could help someone less fortunate than
<ce>             yourself?
<ce>             
<ce>             You can? Oh, thank you! You see...I have this jar
<ce>             of fruit preserve that was hand-crafted by my
<ce>             dear old mother herself, bless her soul. It's an
<ce>             old family recipe, you see. Quite the delicacy.
<ce>             
<ce>             Anyway, I'm having trouble getting the lid off.
<ce>             I'm sure a strong, young %pct like you
<ce>             will have no problems opening an old jar.
<ce>             
<ce>             Can you try?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Oh. Well, I guess I'll ask somebody else then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Thankyou, %ra! Here it is, I'm sure you'll
<ce>             have that lid unscrewed in no time!

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Oh! I don't know what to say! Probably
<ce>             you're very tired from a long day's
<ce>             adventuring?
<ce>             
<ce>             Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Perfect! Thankyou so much! Ah, just smell
<ce>             that delightful aroma. I can't wait to
<ce>             spread that on some sweetroll and get it
<ce>             down my throat!
<ce>             
<ce>             I bet you thought that opening that jar
<ce>             would summon a genie or a daedra or
<ce>             some such thing, eh?! Nope, it's just
<ce>             a perfectly ordinary jar of the finest
<ce>             fruit preserve Tamriel has ever seen.
<ce>             
<ce>             Thanks again, and safe journey brave hero!

The Cartographers are excited. I wonder why? Probably something to do with maps, I guess.

Hail friend! Tell me of the treasurers that my dungeons have yielded up.

We have no further business. Leave me.

%qdt:
 A random peasant has asked me very politely
 to open a jar of fruit preserve. Apparently
 the top has been screwed on very tightly and
 they lack the physical prowess to open it
 by themselves.


Message:  1060
<ce>             It was pretty tight, probably due to the
<ce>             old jam going hard. But it was no match
<ce>             for you!
<ce>             
<ce>             The jar opens with a satisfying *pop*!

Message:  1061
<ce>             After several seconds of embarrassing,
<ce>             nay, undignified panting and straining
<ce>             you are forced to admit defeat.
