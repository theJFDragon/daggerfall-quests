<ce>             Excuse me, %ra? Can you spare a moment?
<ce>             Perhaps you could help someone less fortunate than
<ce>             yourself?
<ce>             
<ce>             You can? Oh, thank you! You see...I have this jar
<ce>             of fruit preserve that was hand-crafted by my
<ce>             dear old mother herself, bless her soul. It's an
<ce>             old family recipe, you see. Quite the delicacy.
<ce>             
<ce>             Anyway, I'm having trouble getting the lid off.
<ce>             I'm sure a strong, young %pct like you
<ce>             will have no problems opening an old jar.
<ce>             
<ce>             Can you try?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Oh. Well, I guess I'll ask somebody else then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Thankyou, %ra! Here it is, I'm sure you'll
<ce>             have that lid unscrewed in no time!

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Oh! I don't know what to say! Probably
<ce>             you're very tired from a long day's
<ce>             adventuring?
<ce>             
<ce>             Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Perfect! Thankyou so much! Ah, just smell
<ce>             that delightful aroma. I can't wait to
<ce>             spread that on some sweetroll and get it
<ce>             down my throat!
<ce>             
<ce>             I bet you thought that opening that jar
<ce>             would summon a genie or a daedra or
<ce>             some such thing, eh?! Nope, it's just
<ce>             a perfectly ordinary jar of the finest
<ce>             fruit preserve Tamriel has ever seen.
<ce>             
<ce>             Thanks again, and safe journey brave hero!

The Cartographers are excited. I wonder why? Probably something to do with maps, I guess.

Hail friend! I'm afraid I ate all of the fruit preserve. Sorry.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You already failed to open my jar. All that fruity goodness is locked away forever!


Message:  1040
%qdt:
 A random peasant has asked me very politely
 to open a jar of fruit preserve. Apparently
 the top has been screwed on very tightly and
 they lack the physical prowess to open it
 by themselves.

 The jar is in my inventory, in case it was
 not abundantly clear.


Message:  1060
<ce>             It was pretty tight, probably due to the
<ce>             old jam going hard. But it was no match
<ce>             for you!
<ce>             
<ce>             The jar opens with a satisfying *pop*!

Message:  1061
<ce>             After several seconds of embarrassing,
<ce>             nay, undignified panting and straining
<ce>             you are forced to admit defeat.

Message:  1062
<ce>             Oh no! That jar was actually a magical
<ce>             prison holding the restrained spirit
<ce>             of an evil daedra!
<ce>             
<ce>             And you just released him into Tamriel!

Message:  1063
<ce>             Phew! The daedroth is dead. Sadly this
<ce>             means that there is no fruit preserve
<ce>             for anybody to enjoy...
