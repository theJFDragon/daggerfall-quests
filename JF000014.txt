<ce>             Hey %ra, you have the air of an adventurer
<ce>             about you. I have a proposition that it would profit
<ce>             you to consider.
<ce>             
<ce>             I am a retired explorer. As you can see I've fallen
<ce>             on hard times. Perhaps you would be interested in
<ce>             possessing my unique collection of maps? In exchange
<ce>             for a small favour, of course.
<ce>             
<ce>             What do you say?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Suit yourself. Those dungeons, and the treasures
<ce>             they contain, will remain a secret.

<ce>             Excellent! During my many travels I once discovered
<ce>             some gold hidden away in ___questDungeon_.
<ce>             Unfortunately I was gravely injured by the evil
<ce>             denizens of that place and I had to flee for my life
<ce>             empty-handed.
<ce>             
<ce>             If you recover the gold for me then I will give you
<ce>             my travel journal listing all the places that I
<ce>             discovered.
<ce>             
<ce>             Oh, one more thing. My old rival and arch-nemesis
<ce>             _rivalNPC_ has been sniffing about after that
<ce>             gold for years. Keep an eye out, just in case.


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             You disappoint me. I pray I find a worthy
<ce>             successor to my legacy soon, else the knowledge
<ce>             of those dark places, and their fabulous
<ce>             riches, will go to the grave with me.


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Bravo! Bravo! Thank %god you have succeeded
<ce>             where I failed all those years ago.

The Cartographers are excited. I wonder why? Probably something to do with maps, I guess.

Hail friend! Tell me of the treasurers that my dungeons have yielded up.

We have no further business. Leave me.

<ce>             "Great %god, you have saved an old
<ce>             pioneer from spending %g3 final days in
<ce>             penury and squalor! This gold will be
<ce>             ample pension for the rest of my days.
<ce>             
<ce>             "And, as promised, here is your reward.
<ce>             I made these maps by my own hand after
<ce>             every expedition. Perchance you may already
<ce>             have stumbled across one or two of these
<ce>             places but most are long-forgotten, their
<ce>             names only preserved in these parchments.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Good hunting %pcf!"

Message: 1061
<ce>             That must be the gold! Now it's time to
<ce>             head back to ___questgiver_.

Message:  1062
<ce>             "No! I've waited years for this moment. The gold
<ce>             is mine....damn you to Oblivion!"
<ce>             
<ce>             _questgiver_'s arch-rival was pretty
<ce>             sprightly for an old-timer. No match for you,
<ce>             of course!

Message:  1063
<ce>             "Ha! So that old back-stabber _rivalNPC_
<ce>             finally met their justly-deserved fate.
<ce>             Good riddance!"

Message: 1064
<ce>             You spend some time copying the details from
<ce>             _questgiver_'s maps into your own map.
<ce>             
<ce>             You also write the names of the dungeons
<ce>             in your notebook for easy reference.


Message:  1070
_questgiver_ seems happier now. I'm not sure why, with %g3 debts!

Message:  1071
_rivalNPC_ is an old renegade. Been getting up to no good for years.
