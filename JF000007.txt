<ce>             What? Who? oh, it's you %pcf. Apologies for the
<ce>             groggy welcome. Everyone is still recovering
<ce>             from last night's annual celebration...ritual.
<ce>             
<ce>             Where were you anyway? Never mind, just make
<ce>             sure you don't miss the next one. Party of the
<ce>             year! Hmmm, now I think about it I don't remember
<ce>             how we got back. Probably Recall spells all
<ce>             around. Anyway, as your head is by far the
<ce>             clearest around here, can you do us a big favour?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Suit yourself %pcf. Must be nice to be
<ce>             able to turn down work, eh?


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Thanks %pcf, nobody here is up for anything
<ce>             heavier than breathing right now. Anyway...
<ce>             
<ce>             Part of the ritual involves the summoning of
<ce>             various...participants to...participate.
<ce>             Anyway, at the end of the party, I mean, the
<ce>             ceremony, we're supposed to dispel them all.
<ce>             But with everyone being blasted out of our
<ce>             skulls I don't know if that happened.
<ce>             
<ce>             Can you head over to ___cult_ and
<ce>             make sure that anything supernatural is
<ce>             shuffled back to where it came from?


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Disappointing %pcf. The Guild has a
<ce>             reputation to maintain and yours just
<ce>             took a right beating. Get out of here.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Did you hear about that platoon of soldiers who went rogue and started pillaging the locals?
<--->
The army sent some men to clear up the bandit problem. Then they decided they'd rather be the bandits!


RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Seems the Fighters Guild couldn't handle those renegade soldiers. Maybe the army will send more troops? I hope they stay loyal!
<--->
The Fighters Guild are fine at dealing with normal bandits. But those army deserters are too much for them. Shame!


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I'm glad the Fighters took care of those renegade soldiers. That's how you deal with traitors!


QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Why if it isn't %pcf. I was just telling someone about how you dealt with those criminal deserters.


QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Hmmm. I've been asked to keep the...sensitive jobs for our more reliable members.

<ce>             This is the place. I wonder what
<ce>             they were up to last night?


Message:  1020
<ce>             The shrine is cleansed.
<ce>             Time to head back.
