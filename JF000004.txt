<ce>             Greetings %lev, I trust this day is treating
<ce>             you well? Whilst you're here, perhaps you
<ce>             could see your way clear to helping me, I mean,
<ce>             the Guild, with a minor problemette?
<ce>             
<ce>             What do you say?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             You disappoint me %pcf. How can I solve these
<ce>             problems myself when my duties forbid me from
<ce>             moving from this exact location? How?!?!


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Jolly good! Now then...it seems that a former Guild member
<ce>             has turned out to be...how to put it?
<ce>             
<ce>             A megalomaniacal, power-crazed, psychopath with delusions
<ce>             of universal pre-eminence and world domination. Yes, that
<ce>             about describes it. The Guild should really be more careful
<ce>             about who they let join us, eh?
<ce>             
<ce>             Anyway, this reprobate got hold of a magic gem and fiddled
<ce>             around with it and the upshot is that %g1 can conjure up
<ce>             duplicates of %g2self, almost at will, probably got a
<ce>             small army of %g2self by now.
<ce>             
<ce>             I'm told %g1's set %g2self up in ___mondung_.
<ce>             I don't know why they do that but it seems to be de rigueur
<ce>             these days. I blame the King of Worms. See if you can't
<ce>             head over there and sort it out. Oh, and don't forget to
<ce>             recover the gem. I have need of it.
<ce>             
<ce>             I promise I won't move from this spot until you return!


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Really now %pcf. Was this really so difficult a task?


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Excellent! Thanks for helping me, I mean, us, with this.
<ce>             Now perhaps the Guildmaster will stop moaning about what
<ce>             my old apprentices get up to, as if that's any of MY
<ce>             business, am I right?!
<ce>             
<ce>             Here, I found these coins in an old box. Why don't you
<ce>             take them off my hands? Too heavy for these pockets...


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Do you know that mage who's been showing up all over the kingdom? And at the same time?!?!


RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Did you hear about that sorcerer who just took over a whole chunk of the kingdom? Weird.


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The Mages Guild causes a lot of problems. At least they clean up some of them, eh?


QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Why if it isn't %pcf. I was just telling someone about how you helped me sort out that renegade and %g3 duplicates.


QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I still haven't forgiven you for letting me, I mean, the Guild, down over that duplicates business.


Message:  1021
<ce>             Somehow you are sure that this particular
<ce>             individual is the source of all this trouble.
<ce>             Check the corpse for that pesky magic gem!

%qdt:
 The Mages Guild continue to cause
 problems with their inefficient
 recruitment policies. Now I have to
 clear up the mess.
 In ___mondung_ 
 there's yet another renegade who
 needs to stop being alive. Seems
 like I'll be finding a lot of evil
 mage types there...
 Note to self: Do not forget to
 bring magic gem from corpse.
 Also note to self:  This job is
 for _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_.
