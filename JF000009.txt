QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>		Yes, %lev, we do have something for you at the moment.
<ce>		Sometimes it is necessary to augment the donations
<ce>		of the faithful with some additional revenue streams.
<ce>		And today is one of those times.
<ce>		
<ce>		I heard a rumour of some bumpkin who's been accussed
<ce>		of consorting with witches or being possessed by
<ce>		daedra or some such thing.
<ce>		
<ce>		These rumours crop up quite regularly and are almost
<ce>		always false. But it does give us an opportunity.
<ce>		I want to you to head over to ___person_ and
<ce>		get this yokel to buy an official Temple Certificate
<ce>		of Qualified Exorcism.
<ce>		
<ce>		That will help mollify any angry neighbours whilst
<ce>		also putting some much-needed coin into our coffers.
<ce>		Everyone's a winner!
<ce>		
<ce>		You will do this?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>		I expected better of you. How disappointing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>		Good good! Oh, here's a blank copy of the
<ce>		Exorcism Certificate. You can fill in the
<ce>		details on your journey.
<ce>		
<ce>		The mark, I mean, poor afflicted soul,
<ce>		lives in ___person_ and I
<ce>		believe they go by the name of _person_.
<ce>		I'm sure the local peasantry will point
<ce>		you in the right direction.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>		This was a simple task. That you have failed.
<ce>		It will not reflect well on the Temple but I
<ce>		assure you that it will reflect worse on you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>		Well done %lev. Take this to cover some sundry expenses.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I know of many amazing and unbelievable things. Or do I? I forget. Who are you?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I heard something about you. I forget the details but something about "neolithic incompetence"?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Actually, I have no interest in this. Please stop talking to me.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>		Good work!

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>		Not now %pcf

<ce>		You begin to suspect that somebody has been
<ce>		selling these "certificates" to every
<ce>		Temple across the Illiac Bay...
<ce>		
<ce>		
<ce>		This certifies that ___________________
<ce>		has been officially and successfully
<ce>		exorcised by a qualified Priest of the
<ce>		Temple of ___________.
<ce>		
<ce>		Date: _________
<ce>		Signed: ____________
<ce>		
<ce>		This certificate is guaranteed to be certified
<ce>		and is certified guarenteed.

Message:  1022
<ce>		"%oth! This is exactly what I need!
<ce>		Of course, the rumours are totally false, spread
<ce>		no doubt by a malcontent with too much time on
<ce>		their hands. Now I can show my face in the local
<ce>		tavern again.
<ce>		
<ce>		"Here, let me give you a consideration for your
<ce>		Temple's good works.
<ce>		
<ce>		"Safe travels, %ra."

Message:  1023
<ce>		"Do you take me for a fool, %ra?
<ce>		
<ce>		"Nobody takes these idle rumours seriously.
<ce>		No doubt it was the product of a child's
<ce>		playful imagination.
<ce>		
<ce>		"If I was to produce one of these "documents"
<ce>		in respectable company then there's a story
<ce>		that would take me a long time to live down.
<ce>		
<ce>		"Now get out of here before I set the dogs on you!"

Message:  1024
<ce>		"They refused! How tiresome! Let me think....
<ce>		
<ce>		"Right, I have an idea. Head on over to the Mages
<ce>		Guild in ___MagesGuild_. We've had
<ce>		some dealings with them in the past.
<ce>		
<ce>		"Speak to _Mage_ and get a magic
<ce>		gemstone of conjuration. Then head back to
<ce>		___person_ and show them that they
<ce>		could really, really benefit from purchasing
<ce>		one of our certificates."

Message:  1025
<ce>		"What's that? Ah, I see that _questgiver_
<ce>		is up to their old tricks again. Well, I'm not
<ce>		one to judge. Not after that accident with
<ce>		the fire atronachs.
<ce>		
<ce>		"Here, this gemstone should be what you need."

Message:  1026
<ce>		The gem glows brightly. The conjuration effect
<ce>		is working!
<ce>		
<ce>		It is only at this moment that you wonder
<ce>		exactly what spell this gem is invoking...

Message:  1027
<ce>		"Enough! Enough! Stop this insanity!
<ce>		Look, here's a bag of gold coins. Take
<ce>		it. Now get out and never return!"


Message:  1030
%qdt:
 The Temple in ___questgiver_
 have sent me to ___person_
 to meet some mug called _person_.
 I am to persuade them to buy this dumb
 "certificate of exorcism".
 Once they've handed over the gold
 I can report back to _questgiver_.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 Amazingly _person_ wasn't as stupid
 as they looked. They refused to pay for the
 phony certificate. I should head back
 and tell _questgiver_.

Message:  1032
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ is a wily old fox.
 I am to head over to ___MagesGuild_
 and speak to _Mage_
 in the Mages Guild there.

 They should provide me with a magic
 gemstone that should persuade
 _person_ to change his mind
 about buying our certificate.
