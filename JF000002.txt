<ce>             We've got a problem and I need someone
<ce>             I can trust. Can you help me out with
<ce>             something unofficial? There's not much
<ce>             money in it, but I'll make sure the
<ce>             people upstairs know who to keep on
<ce>             the right side of.

<ce>             I just hope this doesn't come back to
<ce>             bite us all in the you-know-where.

<ce>             Thanks %pcf. The problem is that one of our
<ce>             Guild members has got sticky fingers. All kinds
<ce>             of things have been going missing. Weapons,
<ce>             supplies, gold, even stuff we've been hired to
<ce>             recover. The last thing that's gone missing was
<ce>             a client's weapon. I'm not sure who's the
<ce>             culprit, but I've narrowed it down to three.
<ce>             
<ce>             _suspect1_ is a veteran fighter but
<ce>             %g1's not taken many jobs lately.
<ce>             
<ce>             _suspect2_ used to be really reliable. Now
<ce>             %g1 spends most %g3 time in the local tavern.
<ce>             
<ce>             _suspect3_ is a newcomer. I don't know much
<ce>             about %g2 but %g1 usually hangs around
<ce>             the Guildhall at night.
<ce>             
<ce>             Have a nose around and see what you can find.
<ce>             And keep it low key, eh?


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Thanks %pcf, if this rot hadn't been cut out
<ce>             it could have infected the whole Guild.
<ce>             
<ce>             Although this was off-the-books there is a
<ce>             special fund for miscellaneous expenses.
<ce>             I know it's not much...


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Disappointing %pcf. The Guild has a
<ce>             reputation to maintain and yours just
<ce>             took a right beating. Get out of here.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I'm not sure what's going on but some people seem to be losing confidence in the Fighters Guild.
<--->
The Sheriff used to regularly call on the Fighters Guild for their services. But lately, not so much.


RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Nobody is telling me why, but some people are steering well clear of the Fighters Guild these days.
<--->
I hear bad things about the Fighters Guild. Wouldn't want to say more than that.


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The Fighters Guild reputation in the town has never been higher. I feel safer already.


QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Greetings my dear %pcf. Thanks again for dealing with that problem.


QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Hmmm. I've been asked to keep the...sensitive jobs for our more reliable members.

<ce>             Yeah, that's the last thing that went missing.
<ce>             I think that counts as damning evidence. We need
<ce>             to take of this problem quietly. And permanently.
<ce>             
<ce>             I'll arrange a meeting with _suspect2_,
<ce>             but you'll be waiting to deal with %g2 when %g1
<ce>             arrives. Understand?
<ce>             
<ce>             Wait in _house_, %g1'll arrive
<ce>             after midnight.


Message: 1020
<ce>             Looks like the only thing %g1'll be taking now
<ce>             is a space...in the local cemetery.
<ce>

<ce>             This matches the description of the client's
<ce>             weapon that was stolen from the Guild!
<ce>             
<ce>             Looks like we have a prime suspect. Time to
<ce>             head back to the Guild and return the weapon.

_suspect1_? I know I've heard the name. Can't remember why.
<--->
I'm sure they live around here. Or they used to. Been a while.
<--->
Sorry, couldn't tell you anything about _suspect1_.


Message:  1027
_suspect2_ is renting a room at _inn_. It's odd because they've got a house here in town.
<--->
I've seen _suspect2_ hanging around _inn_. I don't know why, it's not a nice place.
<--->
_suspect2_, eh? I'd check out _inn_. But you didn't hear that from me, right?


Message:  1028
Oh yeah, I know _suspect3_. Only been in town a few weeks. Seems an alright sort.
<--->
_suspect3_? Nope. Never heard of a _suspect3_.
<--->
_suspect3_? I don't like 'em. Bad knees. Really bad.

%qdt:
 It seems that the Fighters have a
 problem with someone who's in the
 wrong Guild. _questgiver_ gave
 me three names:
 _suspect1_
 _suspect2_
 _suspect3_
 I need to find some evidence to nail
 the thief and then deliver it to
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_.



Message:  1041
%qdt:
 Now the thief is exposed _questgiver_
 wants me to "expel" them from the
 Guild. And Nirn. This is to be
 done in _house_
 after midnight.
