How to install new quests
=========================

You have downloaded some text files but what now?
Hopefully you have several files named "JF0000x"
And also "QuestList-JF.txt"
And this instructions, otherwise how can you be
reading this?

Goto your Daggerfall Unity folder.
Then goto the "DaggerfallUnity_Data" folder.
Then goto the "SteamingAssets" folder.
Then goto the "QuestPacks" folder.

This is where you should already have installed
Warm Ashes and Jay_H's Quest Pack 1.

Make a new folder at this location called "JF".
Put the text files in that folder.

You are now ready to go! Hopefully I didn't make
any quest bugs that cause you any problems...

Note that inside the file "QuestList-JF.txt" it is
defined which quests are active. Any line that
begins with a hyphen "-" is inactive. You can
decide which quests you want and which you don't.
Some are not active by default.

this thread in the daggerfall unity workshop
forums is a good place to report any problems:
