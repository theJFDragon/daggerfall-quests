How to install new quests
=========================

You have downloaded some text files but what now?
Hopefully you have several files named "JF0000x.txt".
And also "QuestList-JF.txt".
And these instructions and possibly a change log.

Goto your Daggerfall Unity folder.
Then goto the "DaggerfallUnity_Data" folder.
Then goto the "SteamingAssets" folder.
Then goto the "QuestPacks" folder.

This is where you should already have installed
Warm Ashes and Jay_H's Quest Pack 1. If you haven't
done that yet then I recommend doing so first.

Make a new folder inside "QuestPacks" called "JF".
Put the downloaded text files in that folder. It
makes it easier for you to remove them later.

You are now ready to go! Hopefully I didn't make
any quest bugs that cause you any problems, but
it is possible. Some of these quests are quite
complex. At least to me.

Note that inside the file "QuestList-JF.txt" it is
defined which quests are active. Any line that
begins with a hyphen "-" is inactive. You can
decide which quests you want and which you don't.
Some may not be active by default.

This thread in the daggerfall unity workshop
forums is a good place to report any problems:
https://forums.dfworkshop.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=2895

TO UNINSTALL:
Just delete the "JF" folder in "QuestPacks".

TO UPDATE:
You can overwrite the text files, or remove the old
ones first and paste in the new ones.

MISCELLANEOUS THINGS:
1) Quest packs are just text files in a specific folder.
   They are not the same as DFU mods (which are files
   with .dfmod extension that go into the "Mods" folder).
   So you won't see quest packs in the "Mods" list in
   Daggerfall Unity's startup screen.

2) Bug-fixes. Once a bug is confirmed I will _try_ to fix
   it. Probably not immediately, but in due course*.
   The fix only becomes effective when the quest is
   started anew. So if you have a save file with an active
   quest that is bugged I cannot help you. Try using the
   console or edit your save text file (pretty tricky)
   or let the quest expire.

3) It is not needed to start a new game to experience the
   new quests.

4) Thanks to Jay_H for making the epic Quest Pack 1 and the
   quest-writing tutorials at forums.dfworkshop.net, without
   which I would have had lots more free time.

5) Permissions: You can do anything you want with these
   quests except benefit financially. I doubt it will be a
   problem.


If you have half as much fun playing these than I did
writing them then I had twice as much fun as you.

Cheers,
theJF
