<ce>             What is it now? Oh, %pcf, it's you.
<ce>             Listen, I'm conducting an extremely important
<ce>             experiment. I need a guinea pig, I mean, an
<ce>             able assistant. I've enhanted some crystals
<ce>             with teleportation spells but it all needs a
<ce>             bit of fine-tuning.
<ce>             
<ce>             Are you willing to help advance the cause
<ce>             of knowledge? It might take a while. A really,
<ce>             really long while, but I can't imagine you have
<ce>             anything better to do?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             With that attitude you won't go far
<ce>             in the Mages Guild. But you might
<ce>             live longer, to be fair.

<ce>             Splendid! The idea was that my teleportation
<ce>             crystals could transmit their bearer between
<ce>             multiple different locations. Unfortunately
<ce>             it didn't go perfectly smoothly.
<ce>             
<ce>             Instead the crystals teleported themselves to
<ce>             %god-knows-where! I can send you after the
<ce>             first one then you can use it to find the next
<ce>             one and so on. Clear? Splendid. Remember, get
<ce>             the three gems and come back here, OK?
<ce>             
<ce>             Well, I'm sure you're all prepared so I'll
<ce>             just send you on your way immediately!


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Disappointing %pcf. The Guild has a
<ce>             reputation to maintain and yours just
<ce>             took a right beating. Leave me.


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             %pcf, I haven't seen you for a while.
<ce>             Have you been neglecting your duties? Oh, no,
<ce>             I recall you were off finding my bothersome
<ce>             teleport crystals. You certainly took your time,
<ce>             I presume it all went smoothly. Yes? Perfect. 
<ce>             
<ce>             Let's see. Ah, yes. An alchemist neighbour
<ce>             of mine has been showing off again so we've
<ce>             been running out of storage. You can help by
<ce>             taking these off our hands!


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Did you hear about that platoon of soldiers who went rogue and started pillaging the locals?
<--->
The army sent some men to clear up the bandit problem. Then they decided they'd rather be the bandits!


RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Seems the Fighters Guild couldn't handle those renegade soldiers. Maybe the army will send more troops? I hope they stay loyal!
<--->
The Fighters Guild are fine at dealing with normal bandits. But those army deserters are too much for them. Shame!


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I'm glad the Fighters took care of those renegade soldiers. That's how you deal with traitors!


QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hello %pcf. Thanks again for retrieving those crystals. They were quite expensive, you know...


QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I hope nobody finds those teleportation crystals and uses them for evil.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 has given me the worst and most annoying
 mission in the history of the Mages Guild!
 I must recover 3 magical gemstones from 3
 different dungeons and bring them all back
 to _questgiver_. Using each
 gemstone will take me to the next.
 I should remember to be careful with the
 third gemstone!

Message:  1041
%qdt:
 Somewhere in ___dungeon1_ is the first gem.

Message:  1042
%qdt:
 I have arrived in __dungeon2_. The
 second gem is here somewhere.

Message:  1043
%qdt:
 I must search ___dungeon3_ and
 find the final gem. I hate this quest.

Message:  1044
 I foolishly activated the third gem.
 It has transported me to an unknown
 location. I should get out of here and
 report back to _questgiver_ in
 ___questgiver_.

<ce>             There can be no doubt that this is the first
<ce>             of the magical teleportation crystals that
<ce>             you have been sent to retrieve.
<ce>             
<ce>             Apparently there is some way to "use" the
<ce>             crystal to trigger its magical effect, which
<ce>             will send you to the general location of the
<ce>             next crystal. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Message:  1051
<ce>             Yes, this is unquestionably the second of the
<ce>             trio of troublesome teleporting trinkets.

Message:  1052
<ce>             You now have the full set of crystals.
