<ce>             Oh! You seem like a helpful %ra. Perhaps you
<ce>             can help me? Forgive my presumption but I have
<ce>             just received some terrible news about my
<ce>             sister. She is desperately ill and the cause
<ce>             eludes the local experts.
<ce>             
<ce>             I have received a letter from a Temple healer
<ce>             this very morning and the situation looks very
<ce>             bad. I would answer the healer myself but my
<ce>             own health is not the best and the letter
<ce>             speaks of considerable dangers.
<ce>             
<ce>             What do you say? Can I put my sister's life
<ce>             in your capable hands? We would be forever in
<ce>             your debt.

<ce>             I pray that the gods send us a true hero.
<ce>             And soon.


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             A thousand thanks to you, dear %pcf!
<ce>             Here is the letter I spoke of. Please act
<ce>             on it immediately, every second could be
<ce>             vital!


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             I have no words for you %ra.


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Praise %god! My sister owes you her life
<ce>             and so do I. Our family will never forget
<ce>             you %pcf. Take these, please, it is the
<ce>             least that I can do.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Watch out for horrible diseases. If you see one, let me know.
<--->
There's dirt everywhere! Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Hey, you're that collosal incompetent that I was told about. How are you?
<--->
Bucket Bob from down the way said you couldn't find his bucket if he was sitting on it.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The voices in my head are very happy to meet you. I, however, am not.
<--->
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 has begged me to do whatever I can to help
 %g3 sister, _sister_, who lives in
 ___sister_.
 I have a letter from a healer who has been
 trying to find a cure. Probably should read it.

Message:  1041
%qdt:
 The letter was from a healer,
 _healer_,
 who can be found at the Temple in
 ___temple_.
 Maybe I should go and see what they have to say?

Message:  1042
%qdt:
 I've been directed to ___dungeon_ 
 to retrieve a unique specimen of the ingredient,
 _ingredient1_. It will be used to
 create a potion which may save the life of
 _sister_.
 I should take the sample directly to the
 potion maker, _potionMaker_, who can
 be found in the Mages Guild in ___magesGuild_.

Message:  1043
%qdt:
 _sister_ has been cured of her condition.
 Well done me!
 I should probably head back to
 ___questgiver_ and let
 _questgiver_ know the good news.

Message:  1044
%qdt:
 The healer _healer_ seems very
 confident that the task of curing
 _sister_ is well within the scope
 of my powers of Restoration.
 I should proceed directly to
 ___sister_.

Message:  1045
%qdt:
 I met with _sister_. Indeed
 she is very gravely ill. She asked that
 I consult with the healer _healer_.

Message:  1046
%qdt:
 The poor soul that was sent to
 ___dungeon2_ to recover the
 sample of _ingredient2_
 has failed to return.
 It seems that it is up to me
 to succeed where everyone else
 has failed.

Message:  1047
%qdt:
 This headache is getting annoying.
 I'm sure it's nothing serious...


Message:  1060
<ce>             I am sorry to report that your sister's condition
<ce>             is worsening. I recommend that, if you can, you
<ce>             visit in person. I'm afraid I don't know how much
<ce>             time your sister has...
<ce>             
<ce>             If this wasn't bad enough I must also warn you that
<ce>             ___sister_ is currently plagued with a
<ce>             gang of bandits that the local Watch seem unable
<ce>             to deal with. If you do make the trip I suggest
<ce>             you take extra precautions.
<ce>             
<ce>             Despite all this bad news there is perhaps some
<ce>             reason for hope, although I must not raise your
<ce>             spirits prematurally. I have just travelled to
<ce>             ___temple_ to consult the most
<ce>             learned of my associates and I pray to have
<ce>             better news to give you soon.
<ce>             
<ce>             Respectfully yours,
<ce>             _healer_,
<ce>             Healer of %god

Message: 1061
<ce>             "Forgive me %ra but I am afflicted with a
<ce>             disease that has confounded all the healers and
<ce>             experts in the district. For your own safety
<ce>             please keep away.
<ce>             
<ce>             "I have engaged the services of _healer_.
<ce>             If you have any ideas maybe you can talk to %g2.
<ce>             I must rest now, I feel very weak. But be
<ce>             assured that I am grateful for your help."

Message:  1062
<ce>             "_sister_'s condition is very grave.
<ce>             There is, however, a thin sliver of hope. One of
<ce>             my learned compatriots is perfecting a potion
<ce>             that they hope will work. The problem is that
<ce>             the ingredients are not only rare, but each
<ce>             sample must come from a specific location.
<ce>             Something to do with unique mineral properties.
<ce>             
<ce>             "The ingredients are _ingredient1_ and
<ce>             _ingredient2_. Our diviners have identified
<ce>             a suitable sample of _ingredient1_ somewhere
<ce>             in the depths of ___dungeon_.
<ce>             
<ce>             "The spellcasters are still trying to conjure up
<ce>             the location of the second ingredient. Take the
<ce>             sample directly to _potionMaker_, who is
<ce>             concoting the potion for us. You will find
<ce>             %g2 in the Mages Guild of ___magesGuild_. Good luck!"

Message:  1063
<ce>             "Great %god! Your reputation proceeds you
<ce>             %pcf! What fortune to have a
<ce>             Master of Restoration at
<ce>             hand in this situation.
<ce>             
<ce>             "_sister_'s disease has resisted
<ce>             every attempt at a cure. But surely you
<ce>             will succeed where we lesser mortals have
<ce>             tried and failed.
<ce>             
<ce>             "I beseech you, make haste for ___sister_.
<ce>             but take care, for bandit gangs are openly
<ce>             roaming the countryside and have even
<ce>             been seen openly in the streets after dark."

Message:  1064
<ce>             Thanks to your mastery of the magical school of
<ce>             Restoration you cast a Cure Disease spell of
<ce>             unparalleled arcane potential. The ethereal
<ce>             psychic frequencies are unmatched.
<ce>             
<ce>             _sister_ snaps out of her malaise
<ce>             and looks around in amazement. She is
<ce>             completely cured!
<ce>             
<ce>             _sister_ thanks you profusely but you
<ce>             sternly recommend that she gets some much
<ce>             needed rest.
<ce>             
<ce>             It is a good deed that you have done this day.

Message:  1065
<ce>             You explain to _sister_ that you have
<ce>             come to try to cure her condition. With a very
<ce>             weak smile she assents, it is clear that the
<ce>             sickness is taking a heavy toll.
<ce>             
<ce>             After trying some diagnostic incantations it
<ce>             becomes clear to you that her condition is in
<ce>             fact two separate but related diseases, one
<ce>             of which is magic-based and the other being
<ce>             mundane. No wonder the local authorities
<ce>             were bemused.
<ce>             
<ce>             Once the arcane vector is countered you
<ce>             realise that the second disease will be
<ce>             easily resolved with a standard Cure Disease
<ce>             spell. You set about your business...

Message:  1066
<ce>             You hear a noise outside. Suddenly the door
<ce>             bursts open!
<ce>             
<ce>             "This is the place. We've got one minute.
<ce>             Take as much as you can. No witnesses."
<ce>             
<ce>             The bandits have moved up to home invasions!
<ce>             Whatever. Time to take out the trash...

Message:  1067
<ce>             "Ah, %pcf, we've been expecting you.
<ce>             We're in luck, the other ingredient was just
<ce>             delivered to me by an alchemist of my
<ce>             aquaintance. With the sample that you have
<ce>             found I can complete the preparation of this
<ce>             potent potion.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Yes, it's ready! Deliver it to the patient
<ce>             as soon as possible. A pleasure to work
<ce>             with you, %pcf."

Message:  1068
<ce>             You give _sister_ the potion and help
<ce>             her drink the brightly coloured, foul-
<ce>             smelling brew.
<ce>             
<ce>             The effect is immediate and she is
<ce>             visibly restored to full health before
<ce>             your very eyes!
<ce>

Message:  1071
<ce>             This is unquestionably the sample that
<ce>             you are looking for. Well done!

Message:  1072
<ce>             The bandits lie in bloody pools on the floor.
<ce>             And rightly so! With this unwelcome
<ce>             distraction resolved it is time to
<ce>             continue your mission of mercy.
