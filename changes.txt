2020-05-31	today I learnt about the difference between ending a quest
		and ending a quest successfully. all quests that did not involve
		the player getting a reward were actually failing. they needed
		the command "give pc nothing" to indicate a successful outcome.

		JF000021 [A Dish Served Cold]
			new quest added for Knights

2020-05-24	more feedback from Jay_H received and acted upon
		more information about quest time limits
		player is (mostly) informed when quests time-out
		apostrophe/quotation mark usage revised
		tweaked some quest membership/rank requirements
		[The Morning After] discovered that JF000007 sometimes fails because the _onsite_ task doesn't register. Weird.
		[Rent-a-Ghost] quest is failed if player decides to kill the ghosts they spawned
		[Best the Beastmaster] renamed from "beat" to "best".
