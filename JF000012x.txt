<ce>             Look here %lev, there's a problem which requires
<ce>             your immediate attention. We have a rivalry with
<ce>             the Guildhall in __rivalGuild_.
<ce>             
<ce>             Some have called this rivalry petty, childish,
<ce>             immature and "frankly unacceptable". But they do
<ce>             not know the true and horrible history behind this
<ce>             vendetta. The story, by the way, need not concern you.
<ce>             
<ce>             A valuable artefact has gone missing and the
<ce>             obvious culprits are those untrustworthy renegades
<ce>             in __rivalGuild_.
<ce>             
<ce>             Are you willing to pop over there and swipe it back?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             With that attitude your future in the
<ce>             Mages Guild seems pretty static.


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Excellent. I have total confidence that, wherever
<ce>             those perfidious turncoats have hidden the trinket,
<ce>             you will recover it without delay.
<ce>             
<ce>             Chop, chop!


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Disappointing %pcf. The Guild has a
<ce>             reputation to maintain and yours just
<ce>             took a right beating. Get out of here.


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Victory is ours!
<ce>

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 is sending me to a rival Guild in
 __rivalGuild_. Apparently they
 have stolen an unspecified artefact
 which I must retrieve.


Message:  1041
 The talisman appears to be totally inert.
 Presumably this is the artefact that
 _questgiver_ wanted. Why can't
 these people be more specific?

<ce>             Hold it right there %ra! What are you
<ce>             doing with that _talisman1_?
<ce>             
<ce>             No, don't even bother to lie to my face.
<ce>             It's obvious that you're one of those
<ce>             buffoons from the Guild over in
<ce>             ___questgiver_.
<ce>             
<ce>             I heard they lost their own _talisman2_.
<ce>             But to try to cover their incompetence by
<ce>             stealing our _talisman1_? Shocking.
<ce>             The Archmagister will hear of this.
<ce>             
<ce>             Now leave, before I unleash a horde of
<ce>             Daedroth on you.
<ce>             
<ce>             And give me that _talisman1_!


Message:  1044
<ce>             Hmmm. This is an interesting _talisman1_.
<ce>             Unfortunately this is not the artefact
<ce>             that those renegades have purloined.
<ce>             However, I'm sure I can find a use for it.
<ce>             
<ce>             Go back and search again. And this time
<ce>             keep your eyes peeled for a truly unique
<ce>             and invaluable artefact. Tally-ho!


Message:  1045
<ce>             You found another talisman? I wonder why
<ce>             they keep leaving talismans lying around?
<ce>             What are they up to? Anyway, it doesn't
<ce>             matter because this is not the missing
<ce>             artefact.
<ce>             
<ce>             Look, I'll be honest. I tried to divine
<ce>             the location of the missing artefact
<ce>             using a very rare spell. Unfortunately I
<ce>             made a slight miscalculation and instead
<ce>             I have been cursed with a strange and
<ce>             very irritating affliction.
<ce>             
<ce>             The curse prevents me from being able to
<ce>             explain to you the nature of the artefact.
<ce>             Instead of revealing the location the spell
<ce>             has hidden the concept of describing it from
<ce>             my own mind.
<ce>             
<ce>             I know it's frightfully esoteric but that's
<ce>             the truth of it. So...please help me out of
<ce>             this bind by finding the artefact.
<ce>             
<ce>             I know they have it there somewhere!
