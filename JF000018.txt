QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             Ah, %ra, I was just thinking about somebody like you.
<ce>             Specifically, somebody motivated by gold, entirely
<ce>             lacking in moral scruple and not afraid of a little
<ce>             blood. Or a lot. Or actually quite fond of it.
<ce>             
<ce>             For reasons that need not concern you I need to
<ce>             take possession of a plot of land. Suffice it to say
<ce>             that the entire provincial economy will benefit and
<ce>             who could oppose that?
<ce>             
<ce>             Well, some fool does oppose it. The selfish
<ce>             malfesant who happens to own the farmstead at
<ce>             ___farmstead_. Instead of selling
<ce>             the property for a perfectly reasonable amount
<ce>             they have refused even to consider negociating!
<ce>             
<ce>             I've requested an Order in Council from the King
<ce>             to issue a Compulsory Purchase Notice but these
<ce>             things take so much time.
<ce>             
<ce>             So, are you going to help me cut through some
<ce>             red tape?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             I recall a time when people like you knew their
<ce>             place and followed orders. We didn't even have to
<ce>             pay. If you refused we just killed you.
<ce>             
<ce>             Oh, how I miss those days...

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Good. This is very simple. But I'll speak slowly
<ce>             so you can write it down in your journal.
<ce>             
<ce>             Travel to ___farmstead_.
<ce>             
<ce>             If they've managed to rustle up a mob consider them
<ce>             as bandits. Kill everyone in possession of a weapon.
<ce>             
<ce>             Then speak to the owner. My new offer for the property
<ce>             is 10 gold coins. Somewhat less than the former price
<ce>             but my generosity didn't take kindly to rejection.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Neolithic incompetence is such an unattractive trait.
<ce>             Depart. And do not return.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Excellent. Ten gold coins for an entire farm might
<ce>             seem parsimonious but the value of the economics
<ce>             lesson we just provided is beyond measure.
<ce>             
<ce>             Speaking of which, here is your payment.
<ce>             
<ce>             Oh, and one more thing. When somebody tells you
<ce>             about the new ebony mine I'm developing, be sure
<ce>             to act surprised.

The Cartographers are excited. I wonder why? Probably something to do with maps, I guess.

Hail fair dispenser of justice!

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
We have no further business. Leave me.


Message:  1040
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 sent me to ___farmstead_
 to extort the property from the owners.

 Anyone bearing arms is to be treated as
 a bandit and summarily executed.

 It is not clear that _questgiver_
 has the authority to issue these orders
 but he pays well.

Message:  1041
%qdt:
 The owner of ___farmstead_
 is now the former owner of 
 ___farmstead_.
 Time to head back and get paid.

Message:  1050
<ce>             We were expecting _questgiver_ would
<ce>             try something like this. No matter what that
<ce>             corrupt, greedy vulture wants we're not
<ce>             selling and we're not leaving.
<ce>             
<ce>             You've got five seconds. You can either walk
<ce>             out of here now or end up buried under the
<ce>             cabbages with the other unwanted salesmen.
<ce>             
<ce>             Your choice, %ra.

Message:  1051
<ce>             Your duties are incomplete. It is not necessary,
<ce>             nor, indeed, appropriate, for us to converse until
<ce>             your assigned tasks are completed.

Message:  1052
<ce>             Looks like the former owner of ___farmstead_ 
<ce>             accidentally, brutally cut off his own head whilst shaving.

Message:  1053
<ce>             Peace has finally returned to the troubled environs of
<ce>             ___farmstead_, albeit by virtue of
<ce>             you having killed everyone under arms.
