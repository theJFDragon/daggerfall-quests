<ce>             %lev, your timing is, as always, impeccable.
<ce>             I feel certain that you will not hestitate to help
<ce>             a fellow knight during a particularly dark time.
<ce>             
<ce>             _knight_ is one of this Order's most
<ce>             accomplished soldiers. Unfortunately we have just
<ce>             received word that his brother has met a warrior's
<ce>             death at the hands of an army of foul, cursed orcs
<ce>             in the depths of ___dungeon_.
<ce>             
<ce>             Naturally _knight_ is determined to avenge
<ce>             his brother and he intends to set off immediately.
<ce>             I don't want to lose another brave soul to those
<ce>             stinking beasts, will you accompany
<ce>             _knight_ and even the odds?
<ce>             
<ce>             It is only fair to warn you that ___dungeon_
<ce>             is absolutely infested with orcs. But the greater
<ce>             the danger, the greater the honour, no?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             I can only assume you have some sort of phobia
<ce>             of orcs. You should try to overcome it, it does not
<ce>             become a member of this Order.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Excellent! With you by his side I am confident
<ce>             that _knight_ will do his brother proud
<ce>             and make it home safely.
<ce>             
<ce>             May %god go with you, %lev.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             You are a massive failure!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Take care, %lev. I feel sure you are destined
<ce>             for the highest ranks in our Order.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I'm hearing lots more talk of hauntings and supernatural goings-on these days. Curious, eh?
<--->
I thought it was only Daggerfall city having problems with the undead. But it's getting a bit unlively around here, if you catch my drift.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I don't know the details but the local Mages and Fighters Guilds seem a little more unfriendly these days.
<--->
I hear whispers of illegal conspiracies but I can't say any more than that. People should keep their mouths shut.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
How am I doing? Me? I'm doing very well, thanks for asking! It's nice not be constantly asked for directions for once!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Why, if it isn't %pcf, my partner-in-crime. As it were. So to speak. *Ahem*.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Hmmm. I've been asked to keep the...sensitive jobs for our more reliable members.


Message:  1040
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 has assigned me to accompany a fellow knight,
 _knight_, on a mission to
 ___dungeon_ to avenge
 his brother's death at the hands of an
 army of orcs.

Message:  1041
%qdt:
 It turned out that this entire quest
 was a deception. _knight_
 tricked his own brother into
 coming to this dungeon under-supplied
 so that his death would leave him as
 the sole beneficiary of their father's
 legacy.

Message:  1042
%qdt:
 The deceiver _knight_ has
 been dealt with and his brother truly
 avenged, though not in the way that
 _knight_ had in mind.

Message:  1043
%qdt:
 _knight_ has gone off solo, for
 the time being. He insisted on avenging
 his brother alone. Once enough orcs
 have been slain to sate his vegeance
 he will find me again.


Message: 1050
<ce>             A man clad in dented but high-quality plate
<ce>             armour steps forward. He looks like he hasn't
<ce>             slept in days but the glint of ruthless
<ce>             determination in his eyes is unmistakable.
<ce>             
<ce>             "%lev, your repution proceeds you. I would
<ce>             prefer to avenge my brother alone, but if the
<ce>             Order demands it then I must oblige.
<ce>             
<ce>             "You will appreciate I am eager to begin
<ce>             at once."

Message:  1051
<ce>             _knight_ is clearly restless as you
<ce>             enter the underground domain. Understandable, as
<ce>             his brother's body lies somewhere in these depths.
<ce>             
<ce>             "This is the place, as if that foul stench wasn't
<ce>             a big enough clue. This stronghold is one of the
<ce>             largest orc bases outside of Orsinium.
<ce>             
<ce>             "Look, I appreciate your coming, but this is
<ce>             something I must do alone. These beasts must
<ce>             atone for my brother's death, but if you want to
<ce>             add a few more to the pile I won't spurn your help.
<ce>             
<ce>             "I'll find you when I'm done killing. It'll
<ce>             take a while..."
<ce>             
<ce>             With that he hurries away into the darkness.

Message:  1052
<ce>             You have found the body of _knight_'s
<ce>             brother. Looks like he fought bravely but
<ce>             was horribly outnumbered.

Message:  1053
<ce>             There you are! And covered in almost as much
<ce>             of this foul orc blood as I am. My brother
<ce>             can never be properly avenged whilst a single
<ce>             orc still lives in Tamriel, but, for today,
<ce>             enough have been accounted for.
<ce>             
<ce>             Let's get out of here. I need ale. A lot
<ce>             of ale.

Message:  1054
<ce>             My dear brother,
<ce>             
<ce>             I trust this letter finds you in good health. I have
<ce>             both good news and bad, though the bad outweighs the
<ce>             good, as is so often the case.
<ce>             
<ce>             Our beloved father's condition continues to worsen.
<ce>             I fear he has very little time left. I pray that,
<ce>             as soon as you are able, you visit him. It is likely
<ce>             to be the last chance you'll have.
<ce>             
<ce>             The good news concerns your expedition to
<ce>             ___dungeon_. I have it on the best
<ce>             authority that the Orcish presence has been
<ce>             massively reduced. Their so-called "king" has ordered
<ce>             his forces re-deployed for some other purpose. I
<ce>             doubt you will encounter more than a couple of
<ce>             caretakers in that hole.
<ce>             
<ce>             I know you were planning to gather more equipment
<ce>             and supplies first, but with this new information, I
<ce>             suggest you complete your mission as soon as possible
<ce>             and head home.
<ce>             
<ce>             I will see you soon,
<ce>             _knight_

Message:  1055
<ce>             "This is not a place anyone would choose
<ce>             for a burial, but we have no option. Please,
<ce>             help me lay my brother's remains to rest."
<ce>             
<ce>             You and _knight_ carve out a makeshift
<ce>             grave as best you are able. The knight
<ce>             mumbles a few words under his breath and
<ce>             stabs a sword into the ground as a marker.
<ce>             
<ce>             "We are done here."

Message:  1056
<ce>             This is not a place anyone would choose
<ce>             for a burial, but you have no option.
<ce>             
<ce>             You carve out a makeshift grave as best
<ce>             you are able and, when you are finished,
<ce>             you drive a sword into the ground as a marker.

Message:  1057
<ce>             You put the letter away but it troubles you greatly.
<ce>             You cannot shake the notion that _knight_
<ce>             deliberately deceived his brother into starting
<ce>             his quest with insufficient supplies, resulting in
<ce>             his death.
<ce>             
<ce>             When you next meet _knight_ you will
<ce>             see what he has to say about this...

Message:  1058
<ce>             _knight_ looks at you with suspicion in
<ce>             his eyes, which widen as you produce the letter
<ce>             you found next to his brother's body. You hand
<ce>             him the letter and ask him to explain.

Message:  1059
<ce>             "You meddling cretin! This is why I didn't want
<ce>             anyone to come with me. I had no intention of
<ce>             coming to this place. Instead this whole
<ce>             charade is for nothing!
<ce>             
<ce>             "My brother was a fool and I was not going to
<ce>             let him take half my rightful inheritance.
<ce>             My father is close to death, but not as close
<ce>             as you!"
<ce>             
<ce>             _knight_ draws his blade and turns on
<ce>             you. Defend yourself, and smite this traitor.

Message:  1060
<ce>             <you read the letter>

Message:  1061
<ce>             You notice a blood-stained parchment on the floor.
<ce>             _knight_ rushes to reach for it but is
<ce>             too slow. Your eyes widen as you read the
<ce>             letter. This was not a mission of vengeance, it
<ce>             was a trap. _knight_ snatches the letter.

Message:  1062
<ce>             _knight_ lies in a bloody pile at your feet.
<ce>             Justice has been done, but not in the way you
<ce>             expected at the start of this quest.
<ce>             
<ce>             You leave the body of the murderer for the
<ce>             vermin and take your leave of this dark place.
<ce>             
<ce>             Though the orcs are monsters you cannot repress
<ce>             a slight pang of remorse at what happened here.

Message:  1063
<ce>             Well done brave knights! Those orcish scum
<ce>             will surely think twice before they tangle
<ce>             with members of our Order again.
<ce>             
<ce>             Now, let us honour our fallen comrade and
<ce>             pay tribute to his memory.
<ce>             
<ce>             Thank your, %lev, for your sterling work.

Message:  1064
<ce>             I am both astounded and astonished! One of our
<ce>             finest swordsmen is a murderer! And what is
<ce>             even worse is you have allowed him to escape!
<ce>             
<ce>             We will have to send somebody else, somebody
<ce>             more dedicated to our ideals, to hunt him
<ce>             down and clear our Order's good name.
<ce>             
<ce>             Why don't you hide your face until things
<ce>             have calmed down?

Message:  1065
<ce>             I cannot believe it! One of our finest warriors
<ce>             a murderer! And of his own brother! I can only
<ce>             thank you for dealing with this scandal with the
<ce>             efficiency and discretion that is fast becoming
<ce>             your hallmark.
<ce>             
<ce>             Please, speak of this affair to no-one. We alone
<ce>             know that justice has been done, and we must
<ce>             keep this truth to ourselves. I am sure you
<ce>             understand, %lev.

Message:  1099
<ce>             You have failed to complete your mission within
<ce>             the alloted time period. _questgiver_ will
<ce>             be disappointed but it's not the end of the world.
