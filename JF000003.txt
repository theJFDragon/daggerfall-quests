<ce>             Hail %lev! Your timing is, as
<ce>             ever, fortuitous. We have urgent need of
<ce>             a Knight whose steed is as fast as their
<ce>             wits, if not faster.
<ce>             
<ce>             The Thieves Guild, curse their empty
<ce>             hearts, have taken a local noble hostage.
<ce>             We know this particular gang and they are
<ce>             no mere amateurs. Rest assured - if they
<ce>             are crossed then the hostage will die.
<ce>             
<ce>             Your duty, if you accept, is to follow
<ce>             their instructions and deliver the ransom.
<ce>             Do you accept this duty?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             You disappoint us %lev.
<ce>             If we do not undertake these quests then who will?


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             I know we could count on you %lev.
<ce>             
<ce>             This gang of kidnappers is well organised and
<ce>             paranoid. They will permit you no leeway in their
<ce>             plans. You will be sent around town, from place
<ce>             to place, to make sure you're alone. If they think
<ce>             you've got any compatriots they'll cancel the deal,
<ce>             which will be unfortunate for the hostage.
<ce>             
<ce>             Your first destination is _house_ here
<ce>             in town. After that you're on your own.
<ce>             
<ce>             Do not deviate from their instructions. Just give
<ce>             them their ill-begotten ransom. Every minute is
<ce>             vital so do not waste a moment.
<ce>             
<ce>             Good luck %pcf.


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Disappointing %pcf. The Order has a reputation
<ce>             to maintain and yours just took a right beating.
<ce>             Get out of my sight.


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Nice work, these things don't always go smoothly.
<ce>             Here's your reward, you certainly earned it!


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Do you have time to talk about the weather? Don't you have something to do?


RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I wonder what happened to the Baroness? Not seen her for a while.


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The Baroness seems happier these days. At least somebody around here has had some good news. 


QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Greetings %pcf. I was just telling someone about how you helped me sort out that ransom problem.


QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
If I was you I would avoid high society for a long while. Still, I guess for you that's not much to ask.

Message:  1045
<ce>             You've run out of time! The Thieves Guild will
<ce>             still deliver the hostage. Just in many, many,
<ce>             small pieces over a long period of time...
