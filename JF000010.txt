<ce>             Stranger! You look like a wandering
<ce>             adventurer in need of an adventure.
<ce>             I can supply you with one, and a
<ce>             generous sum of gold should you
<ce>             succeed.
<ce>             
<ce>             My brother's home has been invaded
<ce>             by a cursed giant! I pray that my
<ce>             brother has found safety somewhere
<ce>             in hiding.
<ce>             
<ce>             Can you deal with the monster and,
<ce>             %god willing, find my brother?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             I pray you do not bear my brother's
<ce>             spirit on your conscience.


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Thank %god. Allow me to
<ce>             elucidate. Last night I was dining
<ce>             with my brother at his domicile,
<ce>             _house_, here in town.
<ce>             
<ce>             After a vigorous discussion about
<ce>             regional politics my brother left
<ce>             the room to attend to some private
<ce>             business. It was then that the giant
<ce>             broke into the room and attacked me!
<ce>             
<ce>             By a miracle I avoided its charge,
<ce>             ran like the wind and made my
<ce>             escape. Please, dispose of the beast
<ce>             and find my brother!


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             I have no words. Leave my presence.

<ce>             Here's your money.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Do you have time to talk about the weather? Don't you have something to do?


RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I wonder what happened to the Baroness? Not seen her for a while.


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Those two brothers, whose names I forget, seem to have put their differences behind them. At last. 


QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
My dear %pcf, thank you again for the great service you have done me.


QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
We have nothing to discuss.

 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 wants me to go to _house_
 to kill a giant and find their
 brother, if he still lives.

<ce>             You strike the giant but your instincts tell
<ce>             you something is wrong.
<ce>             
<ce>             Hesitantly you hold your attack. Before your
<ce>             very eyes the giant growls and writhes as it
<ce>             falls to the floor, twisting and convulsing.
<ce>             
<ce>             In a few seconds the transformation is complete!


Message:  1045
<ce>             I'm grateful you didn't kill me, stranger. I have
<ce>             been afflicted with a terrible curse.
<ce>             
<ce>             I used to be a Warlock in the Mages Guild. One
<ce>             fateful night I was undertaking an extremely
<ce>             hazardous experiment in ultra-high energy magical
<ce>             forces. I don't know exactly what happened but
<ce>             the magical energy got out of control and I was
<ce>             caught in its sphere of influence.
<ce>             
<ce>             Since that day, whenever I am sufficiently angered,
<ce>             the rage is physically manifested in my person and
<ce>             I am transformed into a frenzied giant.
<ce>             
<ce>             You say that _questgiver_ sent you?
<ce>             I pray you do not reveal my condition. Please, say
<ce>             that the giant is gone and that I am safe.
<ce>             
<ce>             A thousand thanks, stranger. Fare well.


Message:  1046
<ce>             Thank you for getting rid of that foul giant.
<ce>             I can only hope that my brother also fled and that
<ce>             he will soon return.


Message:  1047
<ce>             Thank you stranger! I am so relieved to hear that
<ce>             my dear brother is safe. I will be able to face his
<ce>             ill-temper with a smile after this narrow escape.
