A thousand thanks %pcf. I owe you. Metaphorically. In financial terms we're completely even, remember?

%qdt:
 Whilst in ___questgiver_ I happened to meet
 _questgiver_. Unfortunately
 I couldn't understand a word they
 were saying.
 
 I'll ask around town and see if anyone has
 any idea what's going on.

Message:  1041
%qdt:
 Local gossip pointed me to _contactTavern_
 but they were not able to provide any clues
 as to the nature of the mysterious affliction.
 Guess I'll keep asking around town.

Message:  1042
%qdt:
 The local populace suggested speaking to 
 _contactTemple_ but, on talking
 with them, I was told it was not a matter
 that the Temple could resolve.
 Guess I'll keep asking around town.

Message:  1043
%qdt:
 At the suggestion of gossipmongers I
 consulted _contactMedical_, but
 in their opinion this entire affair
 is a staged joke. Not helpful.
 Guess I'll keep asking around town.


Message:  1044
I heard they fell out with their old friend _contactTavern_. Those two spent a lot of time in _tavern_.
<--->
Somebody said _questgiver_ was seen with _contactTemple_, in _temple_. Maybe.
<--->
Maybe check with _contactMedical_, a travelling healer currently saying in _chemist_.


Message:  1045
%qdt:
 _contactTavern_ told me that they
 had hired a mage to put a curse on their former
 friend. If I want to lift it I should speak to
 _contactMage_ in the local Mages Guild.

Message:  1046
%qdt:
 A member of the local Temple told me that the 
 curse can only be lifted by slaying a gargoyle
 that is "the vessel of the curse".
 Whatever that means...
 The creature can apparently be found lurking
 in ___dungeon_.
 Important note: Gargoyles cannot be hurt by
 normal weapons.

Message:  1047
%qdt:
 A rather self-important local alchemist
 said that, in his opinion, the unusual
 speech was caused by physical injury.
 A restorative medicinal ingredient can
 be obtained from _Doctor_ who
 can be found at _DoctorShop_ in
 __DoctorShop_.

Message:  1048
%qdt:
 Typical Mages Guild nonsense! The
 mage who cast this ludicrous spell
 is not the same one that can reverse
 its effects. To do that I have to go
 to the Guildhall in __remoteMagesGuild_
 and speak with _Mage_.
 AND this will cost me 200 gold!

Message:  1049
%qdt:
 Finally, after travelling all over the
 region, I have the solution to this
 cursed problem. _Mage_ gave
 me a talisman that will cancel the spell.
 I just need to give it to _questgiver_
 and then I am done with this quest.
 At least there was some good news...
 _Mage_ forgot to ask for the 200 gold!

Message:  1050
%qdt:
 _Doctor_ gave me the specimen of
 _medicine_ which should cure
 _questgiver_ of his condition.
 I hope so, for I am sorely tired
 of traversing the length and breadth
 of the kingdom for these idlers.

<ce>             "Ah, poor _questgiver_. The case is a serious one.
<ce>             For reasons that are not entirely clear they have inherited
<ce>             a daedric curse, possibly due to a perceived offense by
<ce>             an ancestor. In any event, whilst I was able to identify the
<ce>             cause, I lack the necessary prowess to implement the cure.

<ce>             "If you want to pursue this noble undertaking you must
<ce>             go to ___dungeon_ and slay the curse's vessel, a gargoyle
<ce>             whose name is entirely unpronouncable, except perhaps
<ce>             by _questgiver_."


Message:  1071
<ce>             "Yes, I've looked into the case of _questgiver_.
<ce>             Interesting. But I'm afraid there's nothing I could do.
<ce>             I suggest you keep asking around, if you're determined
<ce>             to help. Good luck."

<ce>             "How tiresome. Yes, we were paid an entirely reasonable
<ce>             sum to perform a perfectly legal arcane transaction.

Message:  1073
<ce>             "I have no idea who _questgiver_ is. I don't
<ce>             intend changing that situation in the foreseeable future.
<ce>             And with my powers I can foresee quite a bit. And I am

<ce>             Suffered a sharp blow to the head and now they can only
<ce>             speak gibberish. It's not exactly my area of expertise
<ce>             but I did communicate with a fellow alchemist who
<ce>             specialises in restorative effects.

<ce>             "I ordered a particular herbal ingredient that should

Message:  1075
<ce>             "Ah yes. _questgiver_. I've already consulted on that
<ce>             case. A waste of my time. In my opinion the entire
<ce>             thing is an act. To what end I cannot say but I am
<ce>             certain this is simple play-acting.

<ce>             "Of course, if you are so inclined, you could seek a
<ce>             second opinion. You might find somebody else in this

Message:  1063
<ce>             The cursed beast is dead. With the final blow
<ce>             you feel a burst of magical energy and hear an
<ce>             echo of incomprehensible words screaming into
<ce>             the infinite void, fading to silence.
<ce>             
<ce>             All of which leads you to conclude that the
<ce>             target monster is dead and you can leave.

<ce>             revenge for an insult given by one of my
<ce>             ancestors? And that you had to hunt down and
<ce>             slay a savage gargoyle in order to break the
<ce>             curse?

<ce>             "I am no expert in these matters but that seems
<ce>             a strangely elaborate, but also oddly arbitrary,
<ce>             curse. I guess the whims of the daedra are
<ce>             inexplicable to us mere mortals, eh?

<ce>             least this nightmare is ended. Thank you %ra."
