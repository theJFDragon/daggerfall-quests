<ce>             Maybe you can take care of this little problem?
<ce>             There's a strange wizard in ___dungeon_
<ce>             who seems to have special powers over the local
<ce>             wildlife. As you can probably imagine he's not
<ce>             using this ability to help anyone.
<ce>             
<ce>             Can you head over there and take care of things?
<ce>             
<ce>             And by "take care of things" I mean, can you kill
<ce>             him and his army of beasts?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             How disappointing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Very good! This contract expires in =timer_ days
<ce>             so make sure this Beastmaster character
<ce>             expires first.
<ce>             
<ce>             On your way then.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             You are a disgrace to the Guild!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Maybe the "army of beasts" was over-stated but
<ce>             it's best to deal with these things early on
<ce>             before they get out of hand.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I know of many amazing and unbelievable things. Or do I? I forget. Who are you?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I heard something about you. I forget the details but something about "neolithic incompetence"?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
You killed what now? Why are you telling me? Get lost!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>		Well done on getting rid of the evil Beastmaster!

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>		I am still not happy with your failure to handle the evil Beastmaster.


Message:  1020
<ce>		The Beastmaster is dead! Now they're just
<ce>		food for the worms. Good riddance.

Message:  1021
<ce>		A spider and a bat.
<ce>		
<ce>		It looks like reports of the Beastmaster's
<ce>		prowess have been somewhat exaggerated.

Message:  1022
<ce>		Isn't there some mystical maniac that
<ce>		we're paying you to hunt down and kill?


Message:  1030
%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild over in
 ___questgiver_ have hired me
 to kill another madman. This
 one is lurking somewhere in
 ___dungeon_
 and goes by the name of the
 Beastmaster! How cliche...
 When it's done I'll report
 back to _questgiver_.


Message:  1080
<ce>		Good work on dealing with the Beastmaster's army
<ce>		of beasts. Here's a little something extra, a
<ce>		long-lost map of a secret dungeon!

Message:  1099
<ce>             You have failed to complete your mission within
<ce>             the alloted time period. The Beastmaster is free
<ce>             continue their reign of terror until a more
<ce>             competent hero can be found.
