<ce>             Maybe you can take care of this little problem?
<ce>             There's a strange wizard in ___dungeon_
<ce>             who seems to have special powers over the local
<ce>             wildlife. As you can probably imagine he's not
<ce>             using this ability to help anyone.
<ce>             
<ce>             Can you head over there and take care of things?
<ce>             
<ce>             And by "take care of things" I mean can you kill
<ce>             him and his army of beasts?

<ce>             How disappointing.


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Thank you. On your way then!


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             You are a disgrace to the Guild!


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Congratulations! Enjoy your well-earned gold.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I know of many amazing and unbelievable things. Or do I? I forget. Who are you?


RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I heard something about you. I forget the details but something about "neolithic incompetence"?


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
You killed what now? Why are you telling me? Get lost!


QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>		Well done on getting rid of the evil Beastmaster!


QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>		I am still not happy with your failure to handle the evil Beastmaster.


Message:  1020
<ce>		The Beastmaster is dead! Now they're just
<ce>		food for the worms. Good riddance.


Message:  1021
<ce>		A spider and a bat. It looks like
<ce>		reports of the Beastmaster's
<ce>		prowess have been somewhat
<ce>		exaggerated.

 The Fighters Guild over in
 ___questgiver_ have hired
 me to kill a bad guy in
 ___dungeon_.
 When it's done I'll report
 back to _questgiver_.


Message:  1080
<ce>		"Good work on dealing with the Beastmaster's army
<ce>		of beasts. Here's a little something extra, a
<ce>		long-lost map of a secret dungeon!"
