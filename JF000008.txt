<ce>Maybe you can take care of this little problem?
<ce>There's a strange wizard in ___dungeon_
<ce>who seems to have special powers over the local
<ce>wildlife. As you can probably imagine he's not
<ce>using this ability to help anyone.
<ce>
<ce>Can you head over there and take care of things?
<ce>And by "take care of things" I mean can you kill
<ce>him and his army of beasts?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>How disappointing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]

QuestFail:  [1003]
