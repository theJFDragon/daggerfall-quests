DisplayName: Bounty on the Mutiny

QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             We've got an unusual bounty on the books
<ce>             right now. A squad of soldiers abandoned
<ce>             their post and turned to banditry.
<ce>             
<ce>             The gang have been causing all kinds of
<ce>             trouble, but it's their boss that the
<ce>             local high-ups are really after.
<ce>             
<ce>             Interested?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Suit yourself %pcf. Must be nice to be
<ce>             able to turn down work, eh?


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Good, here's the deal.
<ce>             
<ce>             First, take out the gang. They were last
<ce>             seen close to ___graveyard_.
<ce>             I don't know exactly where that is.
<ce>             Somewhere here in %crn,
<ce>             but you have a map, right?
<ce>             
<ce>             Their former officer, and current boss,
<ce>             we don't know where %g1 is. We're hoping
<ce>             you'll get a lead on %g2. That's why its
<ce>             called bounty hunting, no?
<ce>             
<ce>             Good luck %pcf.


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Disappointing %pcf. The Guild has a
<ce>             reputation to maintain and yours just
<ce>             took a right beating. Get out of here.


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Good work %pcf! These are the contracts
<ce>             that keep this Guild in business. Take a
<ce>             few days off, relax and come back when
<ce>             you're ready for more.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Did you hear about that platoon of soldiers who went rogue and started pillaging the locals?
<--->
The army sent some men to clear up the bandit problem. Then they decided they'd rather be the bandits!


RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Seems the Fighters Guild couldn't handle those renegade soldiers. Maybe the army will send more troops? I hope they stay loyal!
<--->
The Fighters Guild are fine at dealing with normal bandits. But those army deserters are too much for them. Shame!


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I'm glad the Fighters took care of those renegade soldiers. That's how you deal with traitors!


QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Why if it isn't %pcf. I was just telling someone about how you dealt with those criminal deserters.


QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Hmmm. I've been asked to keep the...sensitive jobs for our more reliable members.

<ce>             This is the place. Might have to wait
<ce>             for them to come back home.


Message:  1020
<ce>             Was that all of them?
<ce>             Now to get a lead on their boss...


Message:  1021
<ce>             You leave the former officer and
<ce>             erstwhile gangboss in a pile of
<ce>             %g3 own dishonorable blood.
<ce>             
<ce>             Now it's time to get paid!

%qdt:
 I have to clean out a gang of
 bandits from ___graveyard_
 in %crn and then hunt down
 their leader, %g3 current location
 is unknown. Hopefully there'll be
 some sort of clue which I can find
 without too much trouble.
 When I'm done I'll head back to
 _questgiver_ in
 ___questgiver_ to get paid.


Message:  1015
 This place isn't secure enough. I've got
 a lead on a much better hide-out, some
 abandoned hole called ___mondung_.
 If it looks as good as it sounds I'll send for
 you and we can plan our next move.
