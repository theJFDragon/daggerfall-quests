DisplayName: Bounty on the Mutiny

QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             We've got an unusual bounty on the books
<ce>             right now. A squad of soldiers abandoned
<ce>             their post and turned to banditry.
<ce>             
<ce>             The gang have been causing all kinds of
<ce>             trouble, but it's their boss that the
<ce>             local high-ups are really after.
<ce>             
<ce>             Interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Suit yourself %pcf. Must be nice to be
<ce>             able to turn down work, eh?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Good, here's the deal.
<ce>             
<ce>             First, take out the gang. They were last seen
<ce>             in the vicinity of ___graveyard_.
<ce>             I don't know exactly where that is.
<ce>             Somewhere here in %crn, but you
<ce>             have one of those special maps that marks
<ce>             every cemetery, graveyard and crypt in the
<ce>             Iliac Bay on it, right?
<ce>             
<ce>             Their former officer, and current boss, we don't
<ce>             know where %g1 is. We're hoping you'll get a lead
<ce>             on %g2. That's why its called bounty hunting, no?
<ce>             
<ce>             By the way, we've only got thirty days to take
<ce>             care of this before the authorities give the
<ce>             contract to one of the Knightly Orders, and we
<ce>             really want this one!
<ce>             
<ce>             Good luck %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Disappointing %pcf. The Guild has a
<ce>             reputation to maintain and yours just
<ce>             took a right beating. Get out of here.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Good work %pcf! These are the contracts
<ce>             that keep this Guild in business. Take a
<ce>             few days off, relax and come back when
<ce>             you're ready for more.


RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Did you hear about that platoon of soldiers who went rogue and started pillaging the locals?
<--->
The army sent some men to clear up the bandit problem. Then they decided they'd rather be the bandits!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Seems the Fighters Guild couldn't handle those renegade soldiers. Maybe the army will send more troops? I hope they stay loyal!
<--->
The Fighters Guild are fine at dealing with normal bandits. But those army deserters are too much for them. Shame!

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I'm glad the Fighters took care of those renegade soldiers. That's how you deal with traitors!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Why if it isn't %pcf. I was just telling someone about how you dealt with those criminal deserters.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Hmmm. I've been asked to keep the...sensitive jobs for our more reliable members.


Message:  1015
<ce>             This place isn't secure enough. I've got
<ce>             a lead on a much better hide-out, some
<ce>             abandoned hole called ___mondung_.
<ce>             If it looks as good as it sounds I'll send for
<ce>             you and we can plan our next move.

Message: 1019
<ce>             This is the place. Might have to wait
<ce>             for them to show up.

Message:  1020
<ce>             Was that all of them?
<ce>             
<ce>             Now to get a lead on their boss...

Message:  1021
<ce>             You leave the former officer and
<ce>             erstwhile gangboss in a pile of
<ce>             %g3 own dishonorable blood.
<ce>             
<ce>             Now it's time to get paid!

Message:  1099
<ce>             You have failed to complete your mission
<ce>             within the alloted time period. The bandit
<ce>             leader has escaped and the Fighters Guild
<ce>             contract is null and void.

%qdt:
 I have to clean out a gang of
 bandits from ___graveyard_
 in %crn and then hunt down
 their leader whose current location
 is unknown.
 Hopefully there'll be some sort of
 clue which I can find without too
 much trouble.
 When I'm done I'll head back to
 _questgiver_ in
 ___questgiver_ to get paid.
 This has to be done within 30 days.
