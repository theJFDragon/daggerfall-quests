<ce>                        %pcn! I have found you.
<ce>               I have been looking for you for many days.
<ce>                I have an important job for you, but may
<ce>               not tell you more unless you will promise
<ce>                              to do it...

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       The vampire clan will be
<ce>                              angry, %pcn.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Good. Now, what I am about to tell
<ce>                 you, you must promise not to speak of
<ce>                 to anyone else. I am a vampire. I was
<ce>               infected many years before you were born,
<ce>                 and have since become one of the most
<ce>                    powerful clan leaders. However,
<ce>                  another is rising. A pitiful excuse
<ce>                  for a vampire, but others listen to
<ce>                him. He speaks out against me, trying to
<ce>                 destroy everything I spent hundreds of
<ce>                  years building up. I need him dead.
<ce>                      Go to ___dungeon_ where this
<ce>                 filth resides. Kill him within =2dung_
<ce>                     days. I will be waiting here.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                          You have done well.
<ce>                    The vampires will not bother you
<ce>                   for a long time, because of this.
<ce>                       We will meet again, %pcn.
<ce>                               I know it.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>	Vampires are dangerous in these parts. They even walk the streets at night.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                    Did you hear? Someone caught a
<ce>                    vampire staying at a tavern here
<ce>                     in town! They're going to burn
<ce>                           him in a few days.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                  Nothing new that I've heard. Sorry.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                      You served the clans well.
<ce>                           What do you need?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                You! Thanks to you, I was almost burned
<ce>                at the stake! Get out of here, before I
<ce>                               kill you!

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
On %qdt,
 _qgiver_ in __qgiver_
 of ___qgiver_ is a vampire.
 He wants me to go to ___dungeon_
 and kill another vampire. I have
 =2dung_ days to finish the task.

Message:  1011
<ce>                         The vampire is dead.
<ce>                         The vampire clans will
<ce>                          be pleased with you.
