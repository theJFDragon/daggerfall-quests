<ce>             Please! I am desperate! Won't you help me?
<ce>             My love has disappeared. I have searched
<ce>             everywhere I can think of but there is no
<ce>             trace of her! I can only imagine that
<ce>             something terrible has happened. I'm at
<ce>             my wits end. Please, will you help me?

<ce>             Why?! Why won't anyone help me?

<ce>             Oh, thank you! You are a saint!
<ce>             
<ce>             _theLover_ has been missing for two days now.
<ce>             She lives in _theLoversHouse_ but
<ce>             normally I find her in _tavern_.
<ce>             She works in the kitchen there most days.
<ce>             
<ce>             The only other place I can think she could
<ce>             possible be is with her best friend,
<ce>             _theLoversConfidant_, but she assures me that
<ce>             _theLover_ hasn't contacted her for several days.
<ce>             
<ce>             Please, god speed and good luck!

 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 has pleaded with me to find his lover,
 _theLover_, who has apparently
 disappeared without a trace. My only
 clues are:
   that _theLover_ lives at
   _theLoversHouse_,
   that she works in _tavern_,
   and that her friend, _theLoversConfidant_,
   may be found in _theConfidantsHouse_.

 It seems odd that _questgiver_
 continually refers to the love of his
 life by her full name...

%qdt:
 I found the missing paramour. The truth of
 the matter is not entirely clear, but at
 least both parties are alive. I was asked
 to return a ring to _questgiver_
 as a final act.

 I found the missing paramour. It seems that
 her heart now belongs to another.
 At least both parties are alive. I was asked
 to return a ring to _questgiver_
 as a final act.

Message:  1043
%qdt:
 I found the missing paramour. It seems that
 _questgiver_ was not entirely as
 he seemed. His "love" wants nothing more to 
 do with him. I was asked to return a ring
 to _questgiver_ as a final act.

Message:  1044
%qdt:
 Whilst investigating the supposed disappearance
 of _theLover_ I was attacked by an
 unknown assailant. Fortunately their combat
 skills were no match for me. Perhaps I should
 liberate their belongings as a form of compensation?

Message:  1045
%qdt:
 I found the missing _theLover_. This
 dastardly plot is now finally unravelled.
 Now it just remains to escort her to safety.

<ce>             Please deliver my belongings to my new
<ce>             address in ___theLoversNewHouse_.
<ce>             
<ce>             I request that you take special care
<ce>             when transporting Whiskers, my stuffed
<ce>             Khajiit toy. I've had him since I was a
<ce>             baby and he is of immense sentimental
<ce>             value to me.
<ce>             
<ce>             So, to be clear, if anything happens to
<ce>             Whiskers I will arrange for your internal
<ce>             organs to be extracted, minced and then
<ce>             re-inserted. And not necessarily via the
<ce>             same "opening" through which they were
<ce>             removed.
<ce>             
<ce>             My sincere regards,
<ce>             _theLover_

<ce>             _questgiver_ is still looking for me?
<ce>             That man is as persistent as he is
<ce>             obsessive. And half as persistent as he
<ce>             is possessive.
<ce>             
<ce>             Look, he might seem harmless enough,
<ce>             a bit sappy, a bit of a mother's-boy,
<ce>             but he's unbalanced and unpleasant.
<ce>             Trust me, I know.
<ce>             
<ce>             Here, just to make everything clear, and
<ce>             permanent, give him back this ring. He
<ce>             said it was his grandmother's. Which I doubt.

Message:  1062
<ce>             _questgiver_? But I told him we were
<ce>             finished weeks ago! I gave him chance after
<ce>             chance after chance to mend his ways, but no.
<ce>             Always my wages disappearing into his stupid
<ce>             get-rich-quick schemes.
<ce>             
<ce>             So you can go back and tell him whatever you
<ce>             like. I'm living here now, with my real
<ce>             soul-mate, _theLoversConfidant_. I don't care
<ce>             who knows.
<ce>             
<ce>             Here, just to make everything clear, and

<ce>             was his grandmother's. Which I doubt.


Message:  1063
<ce>             I know _questgiver_ is looking for me.
<ce>             That's why I'm laying low here. He might seem
<ce>             harmless, if a bit dependent, but I promise you
<ce>             he's jealous, possessive and obsessive. I
<ce>             can't put up with it any more. I'm leaving.
<ce>             
<ce>             I'm only hiding here until the next stagecoach
<ce>             leaves town, then I'm done with him for good.
<ce>             And don't bother to tell him where I am. The
<ce>             innkeeper knows what he's like and if tries
<ce>             anything he'll be lucky to get away with just
<ce>             broken bones.
<ce>             
<ce>             Here, just to make everything clear, and
<ce>             permanent, give him back this ring. He said it
<ce>             was his grandmother's. Which I doubt.

<ce>             What's this? My dear, departed mother's own
<ce>             wedding ring? Oh, my darling, how could you
<ce>             do this to me? Hmmm? What?
<ce>             
<ce>             My grand-mother's ring, she said? I...no.
<ce>             She must have...misheard me. Yes.
<ce>             
<ce>             Anyway. So ungrateful. Still, plenty more
<ce>             fish in the sea, and all that, eh?

Message:  1065
<ce>             What's this letter? Let me see...
<ce>             
<ce>             Hmmm. Very interesting. I think it's time to
<ce>             arrange a little journey. And tie up some
<ce>             loose ends.
<ce>             
<ce>             Thanks for your help, friend.

<ce>             Dear diary,
<ce>             
<ce>             The first part of my genius plan to win the
<ce>             heart (and hopefully a few other parts) of
<ce>             _theLover_ has succeeded. She is
<ce>             safely tucked away in the depths of
<ce>             ___dungeon_.
<ce>             
<ce>             All that remains is to lure that simpering fool
<ce>             _questgiver_ to his doom. Sooner
<ce>             or later he's bound to come here looking
<ce>             for her and when does I'll take care of
<ce>             him. Permanently.
<ce>             
<ce>             (By killing him.)
<ce>             
<ce>             And then I will heroically return to
<ce>             ___dungeon_ and play the
<ce>             part of the gallant rescuer. This will
<ce>             surely win over _theLover_'s
<ce>             affections.
<ce>             
<ce>             The final part, of course, will be to
<ce>             destroy this diary. Just as soon as I've
<ce>             finished revelling in my own brilliance!
<ce>             
<ce>             Signed,
<ce>             Me (Genius)

<ce>             Thank %god! Please, get me out of this
<ce>             accursed Oblivion-hole!

Message:  1068
<ce>             The two star-crossed lovers embrace. They
<ce>             spend some time professing their undying
<ce>             gratitude to you for your heroic bravery.
<ce>             
<ce>             You decide it is time to take your leave
<ce>             before it gets embarrasing.

Message:  1069
<ce>             Finally! Home, at last! I can't thank you
<ce>             enough for saving me from this horrible
<ce>             ordeal.
<ce>             
<ce>             My nerves are in pieces, I must get some
<ce>             rest. But if you ever find yourself in these
<ce>             parts again (snicker) please drop in and
<ce>             I can reward you properly...

<ce>             A very generous woman. Very generous indeed.

Message:  1080
<ce>             I haven't heard from _theLover_ for a 
<ce>             few days. I don't know where they are and I'm
<ce>             starting to get worried. She hasn't disappeared
<ce>             like this before.
<ce>             
<ce>             I've tried calling at her home a few times but
<ce>             she's not there. I don't know what to think.
<ce>             Perhaps I should talk to the Town Watch?
<ce>             
<ce>             Please don't give up! Please find her!

Message:  1081
<ce>             _theLover_ lives here now, with me.
<ce>             She's around here somewhere, I'm sure
<ce>             you can find her.

<ce>             _theLover_? I'm not saying anything,
<ce>             except that she's finished with that creep for
<ce>             good. If I were you I'd just forget all about it.

<ce>             So don't waste your time chasing after her.
