<ce>             %lev, your rank brings you honour and prestige,
<ce>             but all things have a price. Your esteemed title
<ce>             carries with it duties and responsibilities. The
<ce>             brighter the glory, the heavier the burden.
<ce>             
<ce>             In exceptional times, such as these, it is necessary
<ce>             for all men to decide between the letter of the law
<ce>             and the true spirit of justice. In this Order we
<ce>             respect the former but enforce the latter.
<ce>             
<ce>             Which is a very elaborate way of saying that
<ce>             sometimes we must do things which are not strictly
<ce>             legal, but undoubtedly for the common good. We have
<ce>             no shortage of criminals, traitors and renegades that,
<ce>             for one reason or another, have evaded the law and
<ce>             remain at liberty.
<ce>             
<ce>             Will you be the sword of the spirit of justice?
<--->
<ce>             %lev, you have risen to the higher ranks of this
<ce>             Order. This entitles you to learn some of our secrets,
<ce>             but secrets are also a burden. I do not doubt that
<ce>             you will willingly step forward to shoulder your share.
<ce>             
<ce>             Our Order has duties that are not to be spoken of. The
<ce>             legal system is a creation of men, and is therefore
<ce>             fallible. When that system fails we turn to something
<ce>             more divine - the innate spirit of justice that has
<ce>             drawn all of our brother Knights into this Order.
<ce>             
<ce>             Forgive the flowery language. I will be direct. This
<ce>             Order carries out extra-judicial executions on behalf
<ce>             of a secret group of the most learned, respectable and
<ce>             experienced statesmen in the Kingdom. Judges can be
<ce>             bribed, witnesses can be threatened and lawyers can
<ce>             be...well, don't speak to me of lawyers!
<ce>             
<ce>             Will you be the sword of the spirit of justice?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             It is your decision, of course. But I suggest
<ce>             you avoid making influential enemies within
<ce>             this Order. Just a friendly warning.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Excellent, it is a great and noble enterprise
<ce>             that we embark on. Crimes will be punished,
<ce>             wrongs will be avenged and future atrocities
<ce>             will never take place, thanks to you.
<ce>             
<ce>             The information is in this letter. Commit it
<ce>             to memory then destroy it.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             It is a dark day for our Order.
<ce>             And for you in particular.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             You have done well %lev, but
<ce>             we shall not speak of this business again.

The Cartographers are excited. I wonder why? Probably something to do with maps, I guess.
