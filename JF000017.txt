<ce>             %lev, your rank brings you honour and prestige,
<ce>             but all things have a price. Your esteemed title
<ce>             carries with it duties and responsibilities. The
<ce>             brighter the glory, the heavier the burden.
<ce>             
<ce>             In exceptional times, such as these, it is necessary
<ce>             for all men to decide between the letter of the law
<ce>             and the true spirit of justice. In this Order we
<ce>             respect the former but enforce the latter.
<ce>             
<ce>             Which is a very elaborate way of saying that
<ce>             sometimes we must do things which are not strictly
<ce>             legal, but undoubtedly for the common good. We have
<ce>             no shortage of criminals, traitors and renegades that,
<ce>             for one reason or another, have evaded the law and
<ce>             remain at liberty.
<ce>             
<ce>             Will you be the sword of the spirit of justice?
<--->
<ce>             %lev, you have risen to the higher ranks of this
<ce>             Order. This entitles you to learn some of our secrets,
<ce>             but secrets are also a burden. I do not doubt that
<ce>             you will willingly step forward to shoulder your share.
<ce>             
<ce>             Our Order has duties that are not to be spoken of. The
<ce>             legal system is a creation of men, and is therefore
<ce>             fallible. When that system fails we turn to something
<ce>             more divine - the innate spirit of justice that has
<ce>             drawn all of our brother Knights into this Order.
<ce>             
<ce>             Forgive the flowery language. I will be direct. This
<ce>             Order carries out extra-judicial executions on behalf
<ce>             of a secret group of the most learned, respectable and
<ce>             experienced statesmen in the Kingdom. Judges can be
<ce>             bribed, witnesses can be threatened and lawyers can
<ce>             be...well, don't speak to me of lawyers!
<ce>             
<ce>             Will you be the sword of the spirit of justice?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             It is your decision, of course. But I suggest
<ce>             you avoid making influential enemies within
<ce>             this Order. Just a friendly warning.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Excellent, it is a great and noble enterprise
<ce>             that we embark on. Crimes will be punished,
<ce>             wrongs will be avenged and future atrocities
<ce>             will never take place, thanks to you.
<ce>             
<ce>             All relevant information is in this letter.
<ce>             The name of the guilty and their last known
<ce>             location.
<ce>             
<ce>             Make no additional notes and destroy the
<ce>             letter when your task is complete.
<ce>             Sometimes agents of the light must work
<ce>             in the shadows.
<ce>             
<ce>             You have thirty days to complete your task.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             It is a dark day for our Order.
<ce>             And for you in particular.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             You have done well %lev, but,
<ce>             for both our sakes, we shall not
<ce>             speak of this business again.

<ce>             You have slain the target. It is done.
<ce>             
<ce>             Let's hope the wise, noble statesmen
<ce>             who gave this order didn't make a mistake...

Message: 1061
<ce>             Yes, I am _npc_. What of it?
<ce>             
<ce>             Justice? What are you talking about?
<ce>             I was acquitted of those baseless rumours.
<ce>             I had nothing to do with those jurors
<ce>             being poisoned! It was a co-incidence!
<ce>             
<ce>             Somebody help me! I'm being attacked!
<--->
<ce>             _npc_, at your service, %ra.
<ce>             
<ce>             What's that you said? 'Cheating justice'?
<ce>             I have no idea what you are talking about.
<ce>             I was honourably acquitted by a jury of
<ce>             my peers.
<ce>             
<ce>             So what if most of them were members of
<ce>             my own family. It was a very small village!
<ce>             And I have a very large family!
<ce>             
<ce>             Help! Somebody help me!
<--->
<ce>             I told the Chief Justice and the Officer
<ce>             of the Watch. And now I'm telling you.
<ce>             You can't pin anything on me.
<ce>             
<ce>             Anyways, the judge's daughter turned up
<ce>             safe and sound didn't she? No harm done.
<ce>             
<ce>             What are you doing?! No! You can't do
<ce>             this! Somebody help me!

Message: 1062
<ce>             There's a flash of light and _npc_
<ce>             has vanished! Must have had an illusion spell...
<ce>             
<ce>             Invisibility or not, they're still around here
<ce>             somewhere. Sooner or later the spell will wear off.
<ce>             Find them and finish this.
<--->
<ce>             Before you can react _npc_ flings a
<ce>             handful of dust in your face! You are blinded
<ce>             for several seconds but quickly recover.
<ce>             
<ce>             _npc_ couldn't have gotten far.
<ce>             They're still very close by. Find them and
<ce>             put an end to this.

Message:  1099
<ce>             You have failed to complete your mission
<ce>             within the alloted time period. The
<ce>             target has fled, leaving no trace of their
<ce>             current whereabouts.
