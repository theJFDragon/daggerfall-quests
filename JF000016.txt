QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             Greetings %pcf, just the person I wanted.
<ce>             One of our oldest and most illustrious members,
<ce>             _chiefJustice_, has asked for you to call upon
<ce>             %g2 at %g3 home in ___chiefJustice_.
<ce>             
<ce>             _chiefJustice_ used to be the Chief
<ce>             Justice of the Peace in this district. Been
<ce>             retired for while now but still a person
<ce>             of great influence and respect.
<ce>             
<ce>             I expect %g will want your help in some
<ce>             task that is politically sensitive. These things
<ce>             crop up occasionally. It may be a little unofficial
<ce>             but I assure you that _chiefJustice_'s
<ce>             reputation is above reproach and you may
<ce>             have full confidence in their request.
<ce>             
<ce>             What do you say?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             It is your decision, of course. But I suggest
<ce>             you avoid making influential enemies within
<ce>             this Order. Just a friendly warning.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Good show! Pop on over to
<ce>             ___chiefJustice_
<ce>             and look for _chiefJustice_
<ce>             in __chiefJustice_.
<ce>             Good luck %lev!

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             It is a dark day for our Order.
<ce>             And for you in particular.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             I don't want to know what happened, but I'm sure
<ce>             that, in the end, it will have been for the best.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 sent me to ___chiefJustice_ to
 speak with the esteemed former
 Chief Justice of the Peace,
 _chiefJustice_. They can
 be found in __chiefJustice_.

Message:  1041
%qdt:
 _chiefJustice_ has uncovered a
 criminal conspiracy amongst the
 local aristocracy. I have a big
 dossier which contains all the
 information.
 
 Oh, just to be clear, I have to
 kill them all...

Message:  1042
%qdt:
 _target1_ has been dealt with.

Message:  1043
%qdt:
 _target2_ has departed this life.

Message:  1044
%qdt:
 _target3_ has fought %g3 last battle.

Message:  1045
%qdt:
 _target4_'s life has been adjourned. Permanently.

Message:  1046
%qdt:
 The four known leaders of the
 criminal conspiracy have been
 dealt with.
 
 Now I must wait until _chiefJustice_
 contacts me with our next move.
 I am confident they will be in
 touch very soon...

Message:  1047
%qdt:
 I found and killed the man named by
 _chiefJustice_ as the secret
 leader of the criminal cabal.
 
 They had in their possession a
 letter. A very suspicious letter
 that suggests something about this
 entire affair is very, very fishy.
 
 Thinking back over this entire
 enterprise, and studying the
 suspicious letter in detail, I
 think I know where to go next...


Message:  1060
<ce>             Yes, you seem like the sort of soul who can take
<ce>             care of themself. And a few other things to boot.
<ce>             
<ce>             As you may know I was the Chief Justice in these
<ce>             parts for more than twenty years. And a damned
<ce>             fine one, if I may say so myself. As you can guess,
<ce>             any Justice worth their salt will make a few
<ce>             enemies and I've got more than my fair share.
<ce>             
<ce>             The most dangerous criminals aren't those pickpockets
<ce>             and footpads in the so-called Thieves' Guild. Make
<ce>             no mistake, the real criminals are those who hide
<ce>             behind grandiose titles and fancy crests.
<ce>             
<ce>             The local aristocracy don't take it kindly when the
<ce>             magistrates try to apply the letter of the law to them
<ce>             as well as to the local peasantry. I did what I could
<ce>             but, in the end, they took me down. A few words in
<ce>             the right ears at Court, and plenty of dirty gold,
<ce>             and I was "honourably retired from service".
<ce>             
<ce>             It took me a while but I found out who was behind it.
<ce>             A cabal of some of the most influential nobles in the
<ce>             realm. And the dirtiest. Smuggling, bribery, theft,
<ce>             extortion, embezzelement and murder. That's a
<ce>             normal day for these people. It would be easier to
<ce>             list the crimes they haven't committed.
<ce>             
<ce>             I've talked enough. You get the picture. If you
<ce>             really believe in those slogans that all who belong
<ce>             to our Order swear to uphold, you'll want to see real
<ce>             justice done. There are five men. I know four of them.
<ce>             This document has all the information.
<ce>             
<ce>             Until we are ready for the final step I must go into
<ce>             hiding. When they are threatened they will surely
<ce>             come for me. Don't worry, I will send for you.
<ce>             
<ce>             Find them and show them that they may have
<ce>             beaten the law but they didn't escape justice.

Message: 1061
<ce>             This dossier contains an extensive collection of names,
<ce>             dates and addresses. It is a damning summary of the
<ce>             illegal activities that _chiefJustice_ has uncovered.
<ce>             
<ce>             _target1_, county squire. Controls most
<ce>             smuggling activities in the province. Also guilty
<ce>             of bribery, intimidation and murder.
<ce>             Lives in __target1_ in
<ce>             ___target1_.
<ce>             
<ce>             _target2_, priest of %god. The donations of the
<ce>             faithful are diverted to causes that are far from
<ce>             divine and in no way charitable. Lends the cloak of
<ce>             respectability to their wicked co-conspirators.
<ce>             Find them in ___priestHome_.
<ce>             
<ce>             _target3_, baronet and colonel of yeomanry. Who
<ce>             would suspect, and more, dare, to accuse this
<ce>             upstanding pillar of the community? A decorated
<ce>             officer and Peer of the Realm who uses %g3 troops
<ce>             to extort and threaten without restraint.
<ce>             Rumours suggest they are currently on manoeuvres
<ce>             in ___stronghold_.
<ce>             
<ce>             _target4_, Chief Justice! The most audacious chicanery
<ce>             is to have _chiefJustice_ replaced with one of
<ce>             their own. Even if a case could be brought to trial
<ce>             _target4_ will ensure a speedy aquittal.
<ce>             When not in Court you can find them in the Palace
<ce>             in ___palace_.
<ce>             
<ce>             The fifth member of the cartel remains unknown.
<ce>             _chiefJustice_ hopes that the elimination of these
<ce>             four will force their unknown leader to step out of
<ce>             the shadows.

Message:  1062
<ce>             I have nothing more to tell you. The dossier I gave
<ce>             you has everything you need. Once you've done your
<ce>             part I hope that the ringleader behind this
<ce>             conspiracy can be drawn into the open. And dealt with...

Message:  1063
<ce>             _chiefJustice_ sent you? Bah!
<ce>             
<ce>             That old fool! Rest assured that after we've
<ce>             killed you, %g'll be next.
<ce>             
<ce>             Guards!

Message:  1064
<ce>             Benedictus,
<ce>             
<ce>             Let me be absolutely clear.
<ce>             
<ce>             %pcn is not to be under-estimated.
<ce>             I expect that the denizens of ___dungeon_
<ce>             will be no match, although you may get lucky.
<ce>             Just take no risks. Make sure that they do
<ce>             not leave ___dungeon_.
<ce>             
<ce>             Not even in a box.
<ce>             
<ce>             And destroy this note.
<ce>             
<ce>             Make no mistake, if you fail to destroy
<ce>             this note I will personally eviserate you.
<ce>             Then I will have necromancers resurrect
<ce>             your corpse so I can eviserate you again.

Message:  1065
<ce>             What?! Why, this is the most foul accusation!
<ce>             I find you in contempt of court, you
<ce>             detestable insect. And now that you are
<ce>             pronounced guilty it seems only approprate to
<ce>             sentence you directly. To DEATH!
<ce>             
<ce>             Guards!

Message:  1066
<ce>             What foul heresy is this?! The stain of such
<ce>             outrageous lies can only be washed away with
<ce>             blood!
<ce>             
<ce>             Specifically, yours!
<ce>             
<ce>             Guards! Kill this vermin!

Message:  1067
<ce>             An unremarkable peasant in a dirty cloak bumps
<ce>             into you and mumbles some apologies. Before you
<ce>             can chastise them you realise they have passed
<ce>             a note into your hand. The peasant slips away.

Message:  1068
<ce>             That takes care of number four. All of the known
<ce>             targets have been eliminated. Word of this will
<ce>             spread far and wide and probably very quickly.
<ce>             _chiefJustice_ will doubtless use his
<ce>             resources to contact you soon.

Message:  1075
<ce>             You have done well. With his lieutenants out
<ce>             of the picture the shadowy leader of this cabal
<ce>             has been forced to make a move of his own.
<ce>             I doubt you know his name but it is one I know
<ce>             from my years at Court. The Chief Steward,
<ce>             Marlin Benedictus.
<ce>             
<ce>             Either seeking refuge, or perhaps collecting
<ce>             re-enforcements, our enemy has fled from the
<ce>             Court and rode as if Mehrunes Dagon himself
<ce>             was after him, to ___dungeon_.
<ce>             
<ce>             My informants have vanished and all my favours
<ce>             called in. This could be our only chance to
<ce>             cut the final head from this hydra. We must
<ce>             strike whilst we still have an eye on the target.
<ce>             
<ce>             Make no mistake, head directly to ___dungeon_.
<ce>             Find this arch-traitor and put this conspiracy
<ce>             to bed once and for all.
<ce>             
<ce>             _chiefJustice_

Message:  1090
<ce>             The serpentine squire has been suitably squashed.

Message:  1091
<ce>             The perfidious priest has been defrocked for good.

Message:  1092
<ce>             This odious officer has been given the coup-de-grace.

Message:  1093
<ce>             The crooked judge has banged his last gavel.

Message:  1094
<ce>             This note looks curious. Written on some very
<ce>             high quality parchment. The penmanship is impeccable.
<ce>             And strangely familiar...

Message:  1095
<ce>             _chiefJustice_ looks surprised to see you.
<ce>             In fact he looks distinctly pale. His eyes
<ce>             follow your hand as you produce the letter
<ce>             you found on the dead 'ringleader'.
<ce>             
<ce>             The parchment is the same high quality 
<ce>             material as the dossier you were given at the
<ce>             start of this charade. The handwriting looks
<ce>             the same to your untrained eye and, when
<ce>             compared to the letter you received from the
<ce>             peasant messenger there is no doubt that
<ce>             both were written by the same hand.
<ce>             
<ce>             His face turns defiant, almost snarling...

Message:  1096
<ce>             Well done my puppet! You've puzzled out this
<ce>             conspiracy. Or at least most of it. Let me
<ce>             explain the last few details.
<ce>             
<ce>             My former associates and I made a vast sum of
<ce>             money from our nefarious activities. The plan was
<ce>             always to stop after three years, split the fortune
<ce>             equally in five shares, and go our separate ways.
<ce>             
<ce>             Of course, why should I give up four-fifths of
<ce>             a fortune that is entirely mine by right?
<ce>             But thanks to your simple-minded and unquestioning
<ce>             obedience that is no longer a problem.
<ce>             
<ce>             The other witnesses are dead. That just leaves you.
<ce>             Time that you joined them. In Oblivion!

Message:  1097
<ce>             The true ringleader of this conspiracy lies dead!
<ce>             Their foul plot has been broken and the largest
<ce>             criminal organisation in the kingdom has been
<ce>             shut down for good.
<ce>             
<ce>             Or at least for a while...
<ce>             
<ce>             ...until the next power-crazed, money-hungry,
<ce>             back-stabbing degenerate crawls out of the
<ce>             darkness.
<ce>             
<ce>             But you'll be waiting for them.

Message:  1098
<ce>             I didn't give you permission to speak!
<ce>             But you do have my permission to die!
<ce>             Have at you!

Message:  1099
<ce>             You have failed to complete your mission within
<ce>             the alloted time period. The conspirators have
<ce>             gone to ground, covering their tracks and
<ce>             leaving neither evidence nor witnesses.
